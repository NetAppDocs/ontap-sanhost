== Installing the Solaris Host Utilities

You can download the compressed file containing the Host Utilities software packages from the NetApp Support Site. After you have the file, you must extract it to get the software packages you need to install the Host Utilities.

.Steps

.	Download a copy of the compressed file containing the Host Utilities from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/hostutilities/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^] to a directory on your host.

.	 Go to the directory containing the download.

. Extract the file.
+
The following example decompresses files for a SPARC system.  For x86-64 platforms, use the x86/x64 package.
+
`gunzip netapp_solaris_host_utilities_6_2N20170913_0304_sparc.tar.gz`

. Use the `tar xvf` command to unzip the file.
+
`tar xvf netapp_solaris_host_utilities_6_2N20170913_0304_sparc.tar`

. Add the packages that you extracted from the tar file to your host.
+
`pkgadd -d NTAPSANTool.pkg`
+
The packages are added to the `/opt/NTAP/SANToolkit/bin` directory.
+

To complete the installation, you must configure the host parameters for your environment (MPxIO in this case) using  `host_config` command.

+
The `host_config` command has the following format:

+
`/opt/NTAP/SANToolkit/bin/host_config \<-setup> \<-protocol fcp|iscsi|mixed> \<-multipath mpxio|dmp| non> [-noalua] [-mcc 60|90|120]`
+

The `host_config` command does the following:
+

*	Makes setting changes for the Fibre Channel and SCSI drivers for both X86 and SPARC systems
*	Provides SCSI timeout settings for both the MPxIO configurations
*	Sets the VID/PID information
*	Enables or disables ALUA
*	Configures the ALUA settings used by MPxIO and the SCSI drivers for both X86 and SPARC systems.
+
. Reboot the host.

.Example

In the following example, the `sanlun lun show` command returns LUN information.

----
#sanlun lun show

controller(7mode)/                 device                                            host             lun

== SAN booting

.What you'll need
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=71102;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

SAN booting is the process of setting up a SAN-attached disk (a LUN) as a boot device for a Solaris host.

You can set up a SAN boot LUN to work in a Solaris MPxIO environment using the FC protocol and running the Solaris Host Utilities. The method you use to set up a SAN boot LUN can vary depending on your volume manager and file system. See the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMLP2748974/html/frameset.html[Solaris Host Utilities Installation and Setup Guide^] for details on SAN Booting LUNs in an Solaris MPIO environment.

== Multipathing

Multipathing allows you to configure multiple network paths between the host and storage system. If one path fails, traffic continues on the remaining paths.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_non_asa_configuration.adoc[]

The path priorities are displayed against the *Access State* section for each LUN in the OS native `mpathadm show lu <LUN>` command.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_asa_configuration.adoc[]

The output for the `sanlun` command is the same for ASA and non-ASA configurations.

The path priorities are displayed against the *Access State* section for each LUN in the OS native `mpathadm show lu <LUN>` command.

----
#sanlun lun show -pv sparc-s7-16-49:/vol/solaris_vol_1_0/solaris_lun

                    ONTAP Path: sparc-s7-16-49:/vol/solaris_vol_1_0/solaris_lun
                           LUN: 0
                      LUN Size: 30g
                   Host Device: /dev/rdsk/c0t600A098038314362692451465A2F4F39d0s2
                          Mode: C
            Multipath Provider: Sun Microsystems
              Multipath Policy: Native
----

NOTE: All SAN Arrays (ASA) configurations are supported beginning in ONTAP 9.8 for Solaris Hosts.

== Recommended settings

Following are some parameter settings that are recommended for Solaris 11.3 SPARC and x86_64 with NetApp ONTAP LUNs. These parameter values are set by Host Utilities.

[cols=2*, options="header"]
|===
| Parameter
| Value
| throttle_max  | 8
| not_ready_retries  | 300
| busy_retries   | 30
| reset_retries  | 30
| throttle_min  | 2
| timeout_retries   | 10
| physical_block_size  | 4096
|===

=== Recommended settings for MetroCluster

By default, the Solaris operating system will fail I/Os after 20 seconds if all paths to a LUN are lost. This is controlled by the `fcp_offline_delay` parameter. The default value for `fcp_offline_delay` is appropriate for standard ONTAP clusters. However, in MetroCluster configurations, the value of `fcp_offline_delay` must be increased to *120s* to ensure that I/O does not prematurely time out during operations including unplanned failovers. For additional information and recommended changes to default settings, refer to NetApp https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1001373/loc/en_US[KB1001373^].

== Oracle solaris Virtualization

*	Solaris virtualization options include Solaris Logical Domains (also called LDOMs or Oracle VM Server for SPARC), Solaris Dynamic Domains, Solaris Zones, and Solaris Containers. These technologies have been rebranded generally as "Oracle Virtual Machines" despite the fact that they are based on very different architectures.
*	In some cases, multiple options can be used together such as a Solaris Container within a particular Solaris Logical Domain.
*	NetApp generally supports the use of these virtualization technologies where the overall configuration is supported by Oracle and any partition with direct access to LUNs is listed on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=95803;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix^] in a supported configuration. This includes root containers, LDOM IO domains, and LDOM's using NPIV to access LUNs.
*	Partitions and/or virtual machines which use only virtualized storage resources, such as a `vdsk`, do not need specific qualification as they do not have direct access to NetApp LUNs. Only the partition/VM that has direct access to the underlying LUN, such as an LDOM IO domain, must be found in the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=95803;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix^].

=== Recommended settings for Virtualization

When LUNs are used as virtual disk devices within an LDOM, the source of the LUN is masked by virtualization and the LDOM will not properly detect the block sizes. To prevent this issue, the LDOM operating system must be patched for Oracle Bug 15824910 and a `vdc.conf` file must be created that sets the block size of the virtual disk to 4096. See Oracle Doc 2157669.1 for more information.

To verify the patch, do the following:

. Create a zpool.
. Run `zdb -C` against the zpool and verify that the value of *ashift* is 12.
+
If the value of *ashift* is not 12, verify that the correct patch was installed and recheck the contents of vdc.conf.
+
Do not proceed until *ashift* shows a value of 12.

NOTE: Patches are available for Oracle bug 15824910 on various versions of Solaris. Contact Oracle if assistance is required in determining the best kernel patch.

== Recommended settings for SnapMirror Business Continuity

In order to verify that the Solaris client applications are non-disruptive when an unplanned site failover switchover occurs in a SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) environment, you must configure the following setting on the Solaris 11.3 host. This setting overrides the failover module `f_tpgs` to prevent the execution of the code path that detects the contradiction.

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.9.1, SM-BC setting configurations are supported in the Solaris 11.3 host.

Follow the instructions to configure the override parameter:

.Steps

. Create the configuration file `/etc/driver/drv/scsi_vhci.conf` with an entry similar to the following for the NetApp storage type connected to the host:
+
----
scsi-vhci-failover-override =
"NETAPP  LUN","f_tpgs"
----

. Use the `devprop` and `mdb` commands to verify that the override parameter has been successfully applied:
+
`root@host-A:~# devprop -v -n /scsi_vhci scsi-vhci-failover-override      scsi-vhci-failover-override=NETAPP  LUN + f_tpgs
root@host-A:~# echo "*scsi_vhci_dip::print -x struct dev_info devi_child | ::list struct dev_info devi_sibling| ::print struct dev_info devi_mdi_client| ::print mdi_client_t ct_vprivate| ::print struct scsi_vhci_lun svl_lun_wwn svl_fops_name"| mdb -k`

+
----
svl_lun_wwn = 0xa002a1c8960 "600a098038313477543f524539787938"
svl_fops_name = 0xa00298d69e0 "conf f_tpgs"
----

NOTE: After `scsi-vhci-failover-override` has been applied, `conf` is added to `svl_fops_name`.
For additional information and recommended changes to default settings, refer to the NetApp KB article https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapMirror/Solaris_Host_support_recommended_settings_in_SnapMirror_Business_Continuity_(SM-BC)_configuration[Solaris Host support recommended settings in SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) configuration^].
