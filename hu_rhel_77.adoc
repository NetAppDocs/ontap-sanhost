The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.7 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 2: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 7.7 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The RHEL 7.7 with ONTAP storage release has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.

When the storage node returns to an optimal state, the LIFs also come up and the remote port state should read "online".  Occasionally, the remote port state might continue to read as "blocked” or "not present". This state can lead to a "failed faulty" path to LUNs at the multipath layer.
