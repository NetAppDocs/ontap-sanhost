The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 7.0 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The RHEL 7.0 with ONTAP storage release has the following known issues:

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=820163[820163^] | QLogic host hang or path failures observed during I/O with storage failover operations | You might observe a host hang or path failures on QLogic host during I/O with storage failover operations. In such scenarios, you might see the following message: "Mailbox cmd timeout occurred, cmd=0x54, mb[0]=0x54 and Firmware dump saved to temp buffer" messages which leads to host hung/path failure.

In such scenarios, you might see the following message:  "driver's buffer pool is empty, IO busied and SCSI Layer I/O Abort Request Status" messages which leads to host hung/path failures. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=849212[849212^] | Emulex 16G FC (LPe16002B-M6) host hang or path failures are observed during I/O with storage failover operations | You might observe a host hang or path failures on Emulex 16G FC (LPe16002B-M6) host during I/O with storage failover operations. In such scenarios, you might see the following message:  "RSCN timeout Data and iotag x1301 is out of range: max iotag" messages which leads to host hung/path failures. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836800[836800^] | Anaconda displays an iSCSI login failure message although logins are successful during RHEL 7.0 OS installation | When you install the root(/) on a iSCSI multipath’d LUN, the IP address for the  Ethernet interfaces are specified in the kernel command line so that the IP addresses are assigned before the iSCSI service starts. However, dracut cannot assign IP addresses to all the Ethernet ports during the boot, before the iSCSI service starts. This causes the iSCSI login to fail on interfaces without IP addresses. You will see the iSCSI service attempt to login numerous times,  which will cause a delay in the OS boot time. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836875[836875^] | IP addresses are not always assigned during the boot of a RHEL 7.0 OS installed on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN | When you are installing RHEL 7.0, the anaconda installation screen displays that iSCSI login to multiple target IPs have failed though the iSCSI logins are successful. Anaconda displays following error message: “Node Login Failed” You will observe this error only when you select multiple target IPs for iSCSI login. You can continue the OS installation by clicking the "ok" button. This bug does not hamper either the iSCSI or the RHEL 7.0 OS installation. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836657[836657^] | Anaconda does not add bootdev argument in kernel cmd line to set IP address for RHEL 7.0 OS installed on iSCSI multipath'd LUN | Anaconda does not add a bootdev argument in the kernel command line where you set the IPv4 address during the RHEL 7.0 OS installation on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN. This prevents assigning of IP addresses to any of the Ethernet interfaces that were configured to establish iSCSI sessions with the storage subsystem during the RHEL 7.0 boot. Since iSCSI sessions are not established, the root LUN is not discovered when the OS boots and hence the OS boot fails.
