.Before you begin
Verify that your configuration supports by SAN booting. Use the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to check the support for your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version.

.Steps
. Map the SAN boot LUN to the host.
. Verify that multiple paths are available. 
+
NOTE: Multiple paths only become available after the host OS is up and running on the paths.
. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped. For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.
. Reboot the host to verify the boot is successful.
