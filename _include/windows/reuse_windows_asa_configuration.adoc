Depending on your SAN configuration, the host uses one or two groups of paths to access the LUNs.

NOTE: You should only use the number of paths to a single LUN that is necessary. Up to four paths is usually required. More than eight paths might cause path issues during storage failures.

=== All SAN array configuration

For an All SAN Array (ASA) configuration, there should be one group of paths with single priorities. All paths are active/optimized, which means they are serviced by the controller and the I/O is sent on all the active paths.

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with active/optimized paths.
