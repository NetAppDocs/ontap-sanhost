This document describes how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 8.5. For more support and feature information, see link:hu-nvme-index.html[NVME-oF Overview^]. NVMe-oF with Rocky Linux 8.5 has the following known limitations:

* SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is not currently supported.
* In-kernel NVMe multipath is disabled by default on NVMe-oF hosts in Rocky Linux 8.5; you must enable it manually.
* NVMe/TCP is available as a technology preview due to known issues.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

== Step 2: Verify the software version and NVMe configuration

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 8.5 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the required Rocky Linux 8.5 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
Example Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64

== Step 3: Configure NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP

include::_include/nvme/nvme-configure.adoc[]

== Step 4: Optionally, enable 1MB I/O for NVMe/FC

include::_include/nvme/nvme-enable-1mb-io.adoc[]

== Step 5: Verify the multipathing configuration

== Step 6: Review the known issues

There are no known issues.
