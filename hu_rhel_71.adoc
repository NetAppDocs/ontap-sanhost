The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 2: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 7.1 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

In such scenarios, you might see the following message:
 "driver's buffer pool is empty, IO busied and SCSI Layer I/O Abort Request Status"
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836875[836875^] | IP addresses are not always assigned during the boot of a RHEL 7.0 OS installed on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN | When you install the root(/) on a iSCSI multipathâ€™d LUN, the IP address for the  Ethernet interfaces are specified in the kernel command line so that the IP addresses are assigned before the iSCSI service starts. However, dracut cannot assign IP addresses to all the Ethernet ports during the boot, before the iSCSI service starts. This causes the iSCSI login to fail on interfaces without IP addresses. You will see the iSCSI service attempt to login numerous times,  which will cause a delay in the OS boot time.
