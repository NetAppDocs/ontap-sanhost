Configure Proxmox VE 9.x for multipathing and with specific parameters and settings for FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP storage.

FCP and iSCSI with Proxmox VE 9.x have the following known limitations:

* The Linux Host Utilities do not support Proxmox VE 9.x operating systems.
* The SAN boot configuration is not supported.
