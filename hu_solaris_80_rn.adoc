The release notes describe new features and enhancements, issues fixed in the current release, known problems and limitations, and important cautions related to configuring and managing your specific Solaris host with your ONTAP storage system.

For specific information about the operating system versions and updates that the Host Utilities support, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

== What's new

. Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 introduces the setting of  two parameters `disksort:false` and `cache-nonvolatile:true`, which suppress constant sync calls from the host. As ONTAP doesn't have volatile cache, these calls are unnecessary and impact performance. For more information, see the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/solaris/oracle-solaris/11.4/tuning/ensuring-proper-cache-flush-behavior-flash-and-nvram-storage-devices.html[Cache Flush Behavior for Flash and NVRAM Storage Devices].
. Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 facilitates the automated update of FC drivers. The FC drivers that bind the parameters for Solaris 11.4 now use sd (4D) instead of ssd (4D). For more information, see the link:https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2595926_1.html[Oracle Doc ID 2595926.1].
. Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 suports only Solaris 11.4 with both Sparc and x86 platforms. Solaris 11.3 and earlier versions should use the Solaris Host Utilities 6.2.

== Known problems and limitations
