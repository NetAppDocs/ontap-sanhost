|Title	|Description |Workaround
|Running the `linux_gos_timeout-install.sh` script is no longer required on Hyper-V guests running Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server |You are no longer required to run the `linux_gos_timeout-install.sh` script to change disk timeouts on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Hyper-V guests because the default timeout settings are being used. The `linux_gos_timeout-install.sh` script that was included in previous versions of the Host Utilities is no longer included in the Windows Host Utilities 7.1 version. Windows Host Utilities 7.1 uses the default disk timeout settings.|Not Applicable
|iSCSI sessions do not reconnect after reboot with mixed IPv4 and IPv6 |In a Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) configuration or multiple connections per session (MCS) configuration that has both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints, some iSCSI sessions might fail to reconnect after rebooting the Windows host.
|Use either all IPv4 endpoints or IPv6 endpoints. Do not mix IPv4 and IPv6. 
|Multiple connections per session (MCS) is not supported with iSCSI software boot |When using the iSCSI software boot with iSCSI MCS, the iSCSI boot leading connection cannot be protected. This can lead to disconnection from the boot LUN and cause host system disruption.
|Microsoft does not support MCS for iSCSI software booted hosts. Use MPIO as the high availability solution. Note that mixing MPIO and MCS is not supported.
