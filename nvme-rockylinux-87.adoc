Rocky Linux 8.7 hosts support the NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP protocols with Asymmetric Namespace Access (ANA). ANA is equivalent to asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) multipathing in iSCSI and FCP environments and is implemented using the in-kernel NVMe multipath feature.

For additional details on supported configurations, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

.About this task 
You can use the following support and features with the NVMe-oF host configuration for Rocky Linux 8.7. You should also review the known limitations before starting the configuration process.

* Support available:
** Support for NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) in addition to NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC). The NetApp plug-in in the native `nvme-cli` package displays ONTAP details for both NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP namespaces.
** Running NVMe and SCSI traffic on the same host. For example, you can configure dm-multipath for SCSI mpath devices on SCSI LUNs and use NVMe multipath to configure NVMe-oF namespace devices on the host.
* Known limitations: 
** In-kernel NVMe multipath is disabled by default for Rocky Linux 8.7 NVMe-oF hosts. Therefore, you need to enable it manually.
** On Rocky Linux 8.7 hosts, NVMe/TCP is a technology preview feature due to open issues. Refer to the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/8.7_release_notes/index#technology-preview_file-systems-and-storage[Rocky Linux 8.7 release notes^] for details. 
** SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is currently not supported.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting
include::_include/nvme/enable-san-booting.adoc[]

== Step 2: Validate software versions
Use the following procedure to validate the minimum supported Rocky Linux 8.7 software versions.

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 8.7 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the specified Rocky Linux 8.7 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
The following example shows a Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64
----
[start=2]
include::_include/nvme/validate-software-version9-rockylinux-proxmox.adoc[] 

== Step 3: Configure NVMe/FC
include::_include/nvme/nvme-configure.adoc[]

== Step 4: Optionally, enable 1MB I/O 
include::_include/nvme/nvme-enable-1mb-io.adoc[]

== Step 5: Configure NVMe/TCP

== Step 6: Validate NVMe-oF
include::_include/nvme/nvme-validate-nvme-of-rocky-linux.adoc[]

== Step 7: Review the known issues

The NVMe-oF host configuration for Rocky Linux 8.7 with ONTAP storage has the following known issues:

|link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/HOSTUTILITIES/BURT/1479047[1479047^]	|Rocky Linux 8.7 NVMe-oF hosts create duplicate Persistent Discovery Controllers	|On NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts, you can use the "nvme discover -p" command to create Persistent Discovery Controllers (PDCs). When this command is used, only one PDC should be created per initiator-target combination.  However, if you are running ONTAP 9.10.1 and Rocky Linux 8.7 with an NVMe-oF host, a duplicate PDC is created each time "nvme discover -p" is executed. This leads to unnecessary usage of resources on both the host and the target.
