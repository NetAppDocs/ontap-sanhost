== SAN Booting

.What you'll need
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=84067;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}

When the storage node returns to an optimal state, the LIFs also come up and the remote port state should read "online." Occasionally, the remote port state might continue to read as "blocked‚Äù or "not present." This state can lead to a "failed faulty" path to LUNs at the multipath layer as well as an I/O outage for those LUNs. You can check the remoteport's details against the following sample commands:
