Learn how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 8.5. For more support and feature information, see link:nvme-rockylinux-overview.html[Rocky Linux ONTAP support and features].

*NVMe-oF with Rocky Linux 8.5 has the following known limitations:*

* SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is not currently supported.
* In-kernel NVMe multipath is disabled by default on NVMe-oF hosts in Rocky Linux 8.5; you must enable it manually.
* NVMe/TCP is available as a technology preview due to known issues.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting
