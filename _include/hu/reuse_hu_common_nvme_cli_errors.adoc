|===
|Error message  | Probable cause | Workaround
| `Failed to write to /dev/nvme-fabrics: Invalid argument`
|Incorrect syntax
|Verify that you are using the correct syntax for the `nvme discover`, `nvme connect`, and `nvme connect-all` commands.
|`Failed to write to /dev/nvme-fabrics: No such file or directory`  |Multiple issues can trigger this, for example, 
providing wrong arguments to the NVMe commands is one of the common causes.
a| * Verify that you have passed the correct arguments (such as, correct WWNN string, WWPN string, and more) to the commands.
* If the arguments are correct, but you still see this error, check whether the `/sys/class/scsi_host/host*/nvme_info` command output is correct, the NVMe initiator is displayed as `Enabled`, and the NVMe/FC target LIFs are correctly displayed under the remote ports sections.

* If the `nvme_info` command output doesn't display the target LIFs as shown example output above, check the `/var/log/messages` and `dmesg` command outputs for any suspicious NVMe/FC failures, and report or fix accordingly.

|`No discovery log entries to fetch`  a|Generally observed when the `/etc/nvme/hostnqn` string has not been added to the corresponding subsystem on the NetApp array or an incorrect `hostnqn` string has been added to the respective subsystem. a|Verify that the exact `/etc/nvme/hostnqn` string is added to the corresponding subsystem on the NetApp array (verify using the `vserver nvme subsystem host show` command).

|`Failed to write to /dev/nvme-fabrics: Operation already in progress`  a|Observed when the controller associations or specified operation is already created or in the process of being created. This could happen as part of the auto-connect scripts installed above.
a|None. Try running the `nvme discover` command again after some time. For `nvme connect` and `connect-all`, run the `nvme list` command to verify that the namespace devices are already created and displayed on the host.
