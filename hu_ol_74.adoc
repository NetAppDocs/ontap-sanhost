The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on an Oracle Linux 7.4 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with Oracle Linux 7.4 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

NOTE: You can use the link:hu_rhel_74.html#rhel-rhck[recommended settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.4] to configure Red Hat Compatible Kernel for Oracle Linux 7.4.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The Oracle Linux 7.4 host with ONTAP storage has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1109468[1109468^] | Firmware dumps observed on an OL7.4 Hypervisor with QLE8362 card |During storage failover operations on an OL7.4 Hypervisor with QLE8362 card,  the firmware dumps are observed occasionally. The firmware dumps might result in an I/O outage on the host, which might go up to 500 seconds. After the adapter completes the firmware dump, the I/O operation resumes in the normal manner. No further recovery procedure is required on the host. To indicate the firmware dump, the following message is displayed in the /var/log/message file:
 qla2xxx [0000:0c:00.3]-d001:8: Firmware dump saved to temp buffer (8/ffffc90008901000), dump status flags (0x3f)
