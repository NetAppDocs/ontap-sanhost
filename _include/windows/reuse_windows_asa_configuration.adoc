Depending on your SAN configuration, the host uses All SAN Array (ASA) or non-ASA configurations to access ONTAP LUNs. In both ASA and non-ASA configurations, you shouldn't require more than four paths to access a single ONTAP LUN. If you have more than four paths, it might cause issues with the paths during a storage failure.

=== All SAN array configuration

An ASA configuration should have one group of Active/Optimized paths with single priorities. This means the paths are serviced by the controller and the I/O is sent on all the active paths.

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with Active/Optimized paths.
