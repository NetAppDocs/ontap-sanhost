You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 with FCP or iSCSI for ONTAP storage.   

== Install the Linux Unified Host Utilities

NetApp strongly recommends installing the Linux Unified Host Utilities. The Host Utilities help you manage ONTAP LUNs and assist NetApp customer support with gathering information about your configuration. The Host Utilities don't change any settings on your Linux host.

.Steps
. link:../hu_luhu_71.html[Install Linux Unified Host Utilities 7.1].
. link:../hu_luhu_71.html#san-toolkit[Learn about the SAN Toolkit]. 
+
The SAN Toolkit software is automatically installed with the Linux Host Utilities.

== Enable SAN booting
If it is supported by your SAN configuration, you should configure your host to use SAN booting to simplify deployment and improve scalability.

.Before you begin
Use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=84067;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and the ONTAP versionssupport SAN booting.

== Multipathing

You can use multipathing with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 to manage ONTAP LUNs. 

To use multipathing, the `/etc/multipath.conf file` must exist. If the `/etc/multipath.conf` file doesn't exist, you can create an empty, zero-byte file by using the `touch /etc/multipath.conf` command. You don't need to make changes to the `/etc/multipath.conf` zero-byte file because SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 is compiled with the settings (default settings) required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs. 

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 also configures the parameters for all SAN Array (ASA) and non-ASA configurations.

=== Use multipathing to optimize performance

You can use the `multipath.conf` file with the recommended settings for ONTAP LUNs to optimize the performance of your host configuration: 

* You can exclude devices from multipath by adding them to a blacklist.
* You can restore default settings for ONTAP LUNs.

.Blacklist devices

If you have a device that you don’t want multipath to manage, you can exclude it by adding the WWID for the unwanted device to the blacklist for the `multipath.conf` file using the following command syntax:

----
blacklist {
        wwid <DevId>
        devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
        devnode "^hd[a-z]"
        devnode "^cciss.*"
}
----

The following example shows how to determine a WWID and add it to a blacklist.

.	Determine the WWID:
+
`# /lib/udev/scsi_id -gud /dev/sda`
+
`360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833`
+
"sda" is the local SCSI disk that you want to add it to the blacklist.

.	Add the WWID to the blacklist stanza in `/etc/multipath.conf`:
+
----
blacklist {
	     wwid   360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833
        devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
        devnode "^hd[a-z]"
        devnode "^cciss.*"
}
----

[[restore-default-setting]]
.Restore default settings for ONTAP LUNs
The recommended settings are required to support correct operation of ONTAP LUNs. You should always check your `/etc/multipath.conf` file, especially in the defaults section, for legacy settings that might be overriding the recommended settings. For example, a host can override default settings for ONTAP LUNs when it's connected to LUNs from other vendors. You can restore the recommended settings for ONTAP LUNs by adding a device stanza to the `/etc/multipath.conf` file.

The following example shows a `multipath.conf` file that defines values for path_checker and no_path_retry (readsector0 and fail) that aren't compatible with ONTAP LUNs. When SAN arrays are attached to the host, you can correct the values for path_checker and no_path_retry to the recommended values, "queue" and "tur", by adding a device stanza to the `multipath.conf` file that applies specifically to ONTAP LUNs:

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry     fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP"
      product         "LUN"
      no_path_retry    queue
      path_checker     tur
   }
}
----

=== Configure multipathing

The first time you create the `multipath.conf` file, you might need to enable and start the multipath services. You should also verify that the host is configured with the recommended settings for the ONTAP LUNs.

.Steps

. If required, enable and start the multipath services:
+
`# systemctl enable multipathd`
+
`# systemctl start multipathd`

. Verify that you have the recommended settings for ONTAP LUNs:
+
`multipath -ll`
+
The following table shows the critical multipathd parameters for ONTAP LUNs and the recommended values.

=== Examples of all ASA and non-ASA configurations
In ASA and non-ASA configurations, a single ONTAP LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. If there are more than four paths, it might cause issues with the paths during a storage failure.

.All ASA configuration
The following example displays the `multipath -ll` output  for an ONTAP LUN with an ASA configuration. This output shows the correct settings for the ONTAP LUN:
----
# multipath -ll
3600a09803831347657244e527766394e dm-5 NETAPP,LUN C-Mode
size=80G features='3 queue_if_no_path pg_init_retries 50' hwhandler='1 alua' wp=rw
`-+- policy='service-time 0' prio=50 status=active
  |- 3:0:7:9    sdco 69:192  active ready running
  |- 3:0:8:9    sddi 71:0    active ready running
  |- 14:0:8:9   sdjq 65:320  active ready running
  `- 14:0:7:9   sdiw 8:256   active ready running
----

.Non-ASA configuration
For non-ASA configurations, there should be two groups of paths with higher and lower priorities. Higher priority Active/Optimized paths are served by the controller where the aggregate is located. Lower priority paths are active but non-optimized because they are served by a different controller. Non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths aren’t available.

The following example displays the `multipath -ll` output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths. This output shows the correct settings for the ONTAP LUN:

----
# multipath -ll
3600a09803831347657244e527766394e dm-5 NETAPP,LUN C-Mode
size=80G features='3 queue_if_no_path pg_init_retries 50' hwhandler='1 alua' wp=rw
|-+- policy='service-time 0' prio=50 status=active
| |- 3:0:3:0    sdd  8:48    active ready running
| |- 3:0:4:0    sdx  65:112  active ready running
`-+- policy='service-time 0' prio=10 status=enabled
  |- 14:0:2:0   sdfk 130:96  active ready running
  `- 14:0:5:0   sdgz 132:240 active ready running
