[.lead]
You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure Oracle Linux 8.5 with ONTAP as the target.

== Install the Linux Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_installing_luhu_without32.adoc[]

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_cloud_note.adoc[]

== SAN Toolkit

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_toolkit.adoc[]

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=91863;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux (OL) 8.5 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. OL 8.5 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_multipathing_non_asa.adoc[]

The following sections provide sample multipath outputs for a LUN mapped to non-ASA personas.

----

NOTE: Do not use an excessive number of paths to a single LUN. No more than 4 paths should be required. More than 8 paths might cause path issues during storage failures.


== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 8.5 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_recommended_settings.adoc[]

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 no_path_retry fail
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 no_path_retry queue
 path_checker tur
 }
}

== Known issues

There are no known issues for the Oracle Linux 8.5 with ONTAP release.
