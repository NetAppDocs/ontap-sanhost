You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure IBM AIX 7.2 and/or PowerVM (VIOS 3.1) with ONTAP as the target.

== Install the AIX/VIOS host utilities

You must install the AIX Host Utilities Kit while using AIX MPIO with NetApp ONTAP storage.

You can download the compressed file containing the Host Utilities software packages from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/hostutilities/downloads-tab/download/61343/6.1/downloads[NetApp Support Site^]. After you have the file, you must decompress it to get the two software packages you need to install the host utilities.

NetApp AIX Host Utilities 6.1 is the latest release. This release addresses the memory leak issue that was reported in the previous releases. Refer to release notes section for additional information.

.Steps

. Login to your host.
+
* On an AIX host, log in as *root*.
+
* On a PowerVM host, log in as *padmin*, and then enter the `oem_setup_env` command to become root.

.	Download a copy of the compressed file containing the Host Utilities from NetApp Support Site to a directory on your host.

.	 Go to the directory containing the download.

. Uncompress the file and extract the SAN Toolkit software package.
+
`tar -xvf ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.1.tar.gz`

+
The following directory is created when you decompress the file: `ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.1`.  This directory will have one of the following subdirectories:  MPIO, NON_MPIO, or SAN_Tool_Kit.

.	Install the AIX MPIO:
+
`installp -aXYd /var/tmp/ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.1/MPIO NetApp.MPIO_Host_Utilities_Kit`

. Install the SAN Toolkit:
`installp -aXYd /var/tmp/ntap_aix_host_utilities_6.1/SAN_Tool_Kit NetApp.SAN_toolkit`

. Reboot the host.

.Example

In the following example, the `sanlun lun show` command returns LUN information.

#sanlun lun show

controller(7mode)/                  device      host       lun
vserver(Cmode)    lun-pathname     filename    adapter   protocol   size   mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data_vserver      /vol/vol1/lun1    hdisk0      fcs0       FCP       60g    C
data_vserver      /vol/vol2/lun2    hdisk0      fcs0       FCP       20g    C

== SAN booting

.Before you begin

If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=71102;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

SAN booting is the process of setting up a SAN-attached disk (a LUN) as a boot device for an AIX/PowerVM host.  You can set up a SAN boot LUN to work in an AIX MPIO environment that is running the AIX Host Utilities with either the FC or FCoE protocol. The method you use for creating a SAN boot LUN and installing a new OS image on it in an AIX MPIO environment can vary, depending on which protocol you are using.

== Multipathing

Multipathing allows you to configure multiple network paths between the host and storage system. If one path fails, traffic continues on the remaining paths. The AIX and PowerVM environments of the Host Utilities use AIXâ€™s native multipathing solution (MPIO).

For AIX, Path Control Module (PCM) is responsible for controlling multiple paths. PCM is a storage vendor supplied code that handles path management. This gets installed and enabled as part of the Host Utilities installation.

//GitHub issue #114

== Recommended settings for MetroCluster

By default, the AIX operating system enforces a shorter I/O timeout when no paths to a LUN are available. This might occur in configurations including single-switch SAN fabric and MetroCluster configurations that experience unplanned failovers. For additional information and recommended changes to default settings, refer to link:https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1001318[NetApp KB1001318^]

== AIX support with SnapMirror active sync

Beginning with ONTAP 9.11.1, AIX is supported with SnapMirror active sync. With an AIX configuration, the primary cluster is the "active" cluster.

In an AIX configuration, failovers are disruptive. With each failover, you will need to perform a re-scan on the host for I/O operations to resume.

To configure AIX for SnapMirror active sync, refer to the Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Protection_and_Security/SnapMirror/How_to_configure_an_AIX_host_for_SnapMirror_Business_Continuity_(SM-BC)[How to configure an AIX host for SnapMirror active sync^].

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/HOSTUTILITIES/1416221[1416221^] | AIX 7200-05-01 encountered I/O disruption on virtual iSCSI disks(VIOS 3.1.1.x) during storage failover | I/O disruption can happen during storage failover operations on AIX 7.2 TL5 hosts on the virtual iSCSI disks mapped through the VIOS 3.1.1.x. By default, the `rw_timeout` value of the virtual iSCSI disks (hdisk) on VIOC will be 45 seconds. If an I/O delay greater than 45 seconds happens during storage failover, an I/O failure might occur. To avoid this situation, refer to the workaround mentioned in the BURT. As per IBM, after applying APAR - IJ34739 (upcoming release) we can dynamically change the rw_timeout value using the `chdev` command. | NA
