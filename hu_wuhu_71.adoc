. Check the hotfixes required for your Windows Server host version in the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/index.html[SAN host Windows documentation].
+
For example, the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-sanhost/hu_windows_2022.html[Configure Windows Server 2022 for ONTAP storage] documentation provides the instructions for installing Windows hotfixes for Windows server 2022.
