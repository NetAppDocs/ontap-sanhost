The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1089555[1089555^] | Kernel disruption observed on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 16GB FC during storage failover operation | A kernel disruption might occur during storage failover operations on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 HBA. The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module “lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51.

Recover the operating system after the kernel disruption by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application.

The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module
“lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76.

Recover the operating system after the kernel disruption by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1117248[1117248^] | Kernel disruption observed on SLES12SP3 with QLogic QLE2562 8GB FC during storage failover operations |  During storage failover operations on the Sles12sp3 kernel (kernel-default-4.4.82-6.3.1) with QLogic QLE2562 HBA, the kernel disruption was observed due to a panic in the kernel. The kernel panic leads to a reboot of the operating system, causing an application disruption. The kernel panic generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. Upon the kernel panic, the vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case, the panic was observed in the “blk_finish_request+289” module.
It is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:
"exception RIP: blk_finish_request+289"

After the kernel disruption, you can recover the operating system  by rebooting the Host OS. You can restart the application as required.

This prompts a reboot of the operating system causing application disruption. The kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case the Kernel disruption was observed in the module "unknown or invalid address" and is logged in vmcore file with the following string - exception RIP: unknown or invalid address.

After kernel disruption, the operating system can be recovered by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application as required.

This prompts a reboot of the operating system causing application disruption. The kernel disruption
generates a vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file can be used to understand the cause
of the failure.
Example:
In this case kernel disruption was observed in the module “raw_spin_lock_irqsave+30” and is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:
– exception RIP: _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+30.

After kernel disruption, the operating system can be recovered by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application as required.
