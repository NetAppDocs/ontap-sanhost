[.lead]
You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 with ONTAP as the target. 

== Install the Linux Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_installing_luhu_with32.adoc[]

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_cloud_note.adoc[]

== SAN Toolkit

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_toolkit.adoc[]

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.5 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. RHEL 6.5 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 6.5 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
