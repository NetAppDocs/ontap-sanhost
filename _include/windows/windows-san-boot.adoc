.SAN boot
--
If you choose to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration.

.Before you begin
Use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Windows OS, host bus adapter (HBA), HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.

.Steps
. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-admin/provision-storage.html[Create a SAN boot LUN and map it to the host^].

. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped. 
+
For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.
. Verify that the configuration was successful by rebooting the host and verifying that the OS is up and running.

.Local boot
--
Perform a local boot by installing the Windows OS on the local hard disk, for example, on an SSD, SATA, or RAID.
