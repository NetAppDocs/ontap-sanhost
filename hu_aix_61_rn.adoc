Sanlun’s `lun show -p` option provides the multipathing information for all the LUNs discovered on a host. It arranges this information to present which SCSI device is sourced from which LUN, the path state (primary or secondary), and other details. However, on some AIX hosts running the `sanlun lun show -p` command might cause a memory fault. This issue is observed only when you run the sanlun command with the `-p` option.

|AIX HU Sanlun reports incorrect HBA speed	|Instances of sanlun displaying incorrect HBA speeds are reported while running the `sanlun fcp show adapter –v` command.  The `sanlun fcp show adapter –v` command displays the HBA cards information, such as supported and negotiated speeds for the adapters. This seems to be a reporting issue only. To identify the actual speed, use the `fcstat fcsx` command.
