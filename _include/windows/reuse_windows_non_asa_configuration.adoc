For a non-ASA configuration, there should be two groups of paths with different priorities. The paths with higher priorities are Active/Optimized, which means they are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located. The paths with lower priorities are active but non-optimized because they are served from a different controller.

NOTE: The non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths are not available.

.Example

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two active/optimized paths and two active/non-optimized paths.
