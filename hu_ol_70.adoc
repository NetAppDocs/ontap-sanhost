[.lead]
The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on an Oracle Linux 7.0 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with Oracle Linux 7.0 to manage ONTAP LUNs. Oracle Linux 7.0 supports Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) R3 and UEK R4. The OS boots with UEK R3 kernel by default

NOTE: You can use the link:hu_rhel_70.html#rhel-rhck[recommended settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0] to configure Red Hat Compatible Kernel for Oracle Linux 7.0.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The Oracle Linux 7.0 host with ONTAP storage has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=901558[901558^] | OL7.0 : Host loses all paths to the lun and hangs due to "RSCN timeout" error on OL 7.0 UEK r3U5 Beta on Emulex 8G(LPe12002) host | You might observe that the Emulex 8G(LPe12002) host hangs and there is a high I/O outage during storage failover operations with I/O. You might observe paths not recovering, which is a result of the RSCN timeout, due to which the host loses all the paths and hangs. Probability of hitting this issue is high. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=901557[901557^] | OL 7.0: High I/O outage observed on QLogic 8G FC (QLE2562) SAN host during storage failover operations with I/O | You might observe high I/O outage on QLogic 8G FC (QLE2562) host during storage failover operations with I/O. Aborts and Device resets manifests as I/O outage on the host. Probability of hitting this I/O outage is high. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894766[894766^] |  OL7.0: Dracut fails to include scsi_dh_alua.ko module in initramfs on UEKR3U5 alpha | The scsi_dh_alua module might not load even after adding the parameter "rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua" in the kernel command line and creating Dracut. As a result, ALUA is not enabled for NetApp LUNs as recommended. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894796[894796^] | Anaconda displays an iSCSI login failure message although logins are successful during OL 7.0 OS installation |  When you are installing OL 7.0, the anaconda installation screen displays that iSCSI login to multiple target IPs have failed though the iSCSI logins are successful. Anaconda displays following error message:
 "Node Login Failed"
 You will observe this error only when you select multiple target IPs for iSCSI login.
 You can continue the OS installation by clicking the "ok" button. This bug does not hamper either the iSCSI or the OL 7.0 OS installation. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894771[894771^] | OL7.0 : Anaconda does not add bootdev argument in kernel cmd line to set IP address for iSCSI SANboot OS install | Anaconda does not add a bootdev argument in the kernel command line where you set the IPv4 address during the OL 7.0 OS installation on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN. Owing to this, you cannot assign IP addresses to any of the Ethernet interfaces that were configured to establish iSCSI sessions with the storage subsystem during the OL 7.0 boot. Since iSCSI sessions are not established, the root LUN is not discovered when the OS boots and hence the OS boot fails. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=916501[916501^] |	Qlogic 10G FCoE (QLE8152) host kernel crash observed during storage failover operations with I/O | You might observe a kernel crash in Qlogic driver module on 10G FCoE Qlogic (QLE8152) host. The crash occurs during storage failover operations with I/O. Probability of hitting this crash is high which leads to longer I/O outage on the host.
