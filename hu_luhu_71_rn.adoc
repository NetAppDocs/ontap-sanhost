== What's new in the 7.1 release

Linux Host Utilities is now called _Linux Unified Host Utilities_ because it supports NetApp E-Series storage systems running SANtricity as well as AFF and FAS systems running ONTAP.

[NOTE]
Any mention of Host Utilities or Linux Host Utilities in this document refers to Linux Unified Host Utilities.

* This release of the Linux Unified Host Utilities provides support for a tuned package for setting server profiles and improving I/O performance on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 hosts.

* The Linux Unified Host Utilities 7.1 continues to support versions of the following:

** Red Hat Enterprise Linux
** SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
** Oracle Linux
** Oracle VM
** Citrix XenServer
** Veritas

*	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 now have a tuned package with a `tuned-adm` command to set different server profiles on the host depending on the environment.
**	This includes an enterprise storage profile for configurations where LUNs from enterprise storage arrays are used. You can also use the virtual guest profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a guest virtual machine. Using these tuned packages can result in marked improvement in throughput and latency on ONTAP.


[NOTE]
NetApp continues to work with the Host Utilities to add support for features after the initial release. For latest information about the features that are supported and the new features that have been added, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=65623;64703;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].
