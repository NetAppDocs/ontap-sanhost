[NOTE] 
====
* This toolkit is common across all configurations and protocols of the Host Utilities. As a result, some of its contents apply to one configuration, but not another. Having unused components doesn't affect your system performance. 

* The SAN Toolkit isn't supported on Citrix XenServer, Oracle VM, and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor.
