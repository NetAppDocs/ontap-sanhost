== What's New in Linux Host Utilities 8.0
The Linux Host Utilities 8.0 release contains the following new features and enhancements

Linux Host Utilities 8.0 includes support for 64-bit speed QLogic and Emulex FC host bus adapters (HBA). 

The following operating systems are now supported:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 and 8 series
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 
* Oracle Linux 9 and 8 series
* Ubuntu

== What's New in Linux Host Utilities 7.1
The Linux Host Utilities 7.1 release contains the following new features and enhancements:

* Linux Host Utilities is now called _Linux Unified Host Utilities_ because it supports NetApp E-Series storage systems running SANtricity as well as AFF, FAS, and ASA systems running ONTAP.

* The following operating systems are now supported:

**	Citrix XenServer
**	KVM and XEN, RHEV 6.5 and 6.4
**	Oracle VM 3.2 series
**	Oracle Linux 7 and 6 series
**	RHEL 7 and 6 series
**	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 series
**	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4

* On RHEL 6 and 7 hosts, a tuned package for setting server profiles is now supported. You can use the `tuned-adm` command to set different profiles, depending on the environment. For example, you can use the virtual guest profile as a guest virtual machine and the enterprise storage profile for configurations when LUNs from enterprise storage arrays are used. Using these tuned packages can result in improvement in throughput and latency in ONTAP.

* Linux Host Utilities 7.1 adds support for 32GB FC adapters from Broadcom Emulex and Marvell Qlogic.

[NOTE]
NetApp continues to work with the Linux Host Utilities to add support for features after the initial release. For latest information about the features that are supported and the new features that have been added, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].
