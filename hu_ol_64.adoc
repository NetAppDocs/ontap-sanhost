== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=65623;64703;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux 6.4 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. Oracle Linux 6.4 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 6.4 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs.
If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no

 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| Bugzilla ID
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=713555[713555^] | QLogic adapter resets are seen on OL6.4 and OL5.9 with UEK2 on controller faults such as takeover/giveback, and reboot | QLogic adapter resets are seen on OL6.4 hosts with UEK2 (kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el6uek) or OL5.9 hosts with UEK2 (kernel-uek-2.6.39 400.17.1.el5uek) when controller faults happen (such as takeover, giveback, and reboots). These resets are intermittent. When these adapter resets happen, a prolonged I/O outage (sometimes, more than 10 minutes) might occur until the adapter resets succeed and the paths' status are updated by dm-multipath.

 In /var/log/messages, messages similar to the following are seen when this bug
 is hit:
 kernel: qla2xxx [0000:11:00.0]-8018:0: ADAPTER RESET ISSUED nexus=0:2:13.

 This is observed with the kernel version:
 On OL6.4: kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el6uek
 On OL5.9: kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el5uek

| link:htthttps://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=715217[715217^] | 	Delay in path recovery on OL6.4 or OL5.9 hosts with UEK2 may result in delayed I/O resumption on controller or fabric faults | When a controller fault (storage failover or giveback, reboots and so on) or a fabric fault (FC port disable or enable) occurs with I/O on Oracle Linux 6.4 or Oracle Linux 5.9 hosts with UEK2 Kernel, the path recovery by DM-Multipath takes a long time (4mins. to 10 mins).
Sometimes, during the paths recovering to active state, the following lpfc driver errors are also seen:
 kernel: sd 0:0:8:3: [sdlt]  Result: hostbyte=DID_ERROR driverbyte=DRIVER_OK

 Due to this delay in path recovery during fault events, the I/O resumption also delays.

 OL 6.4 Versions:
 device-mapper-1.02.77-9.el6
 device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el6
 kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el6uek

 OL 5.9 Versions:
 device-mapper-1.02.77-9.el5
 device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el5
 kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el5uek

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=709911[709911^] | DM Multipath on OL6.4 & OL5.9 iSCSI with UEK2 kernel takes long time to update LUN path status after storage faults |  On systems running Oracle Linux 6 Update4 and Oracle Linux 5 Update9 iSCSI with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 2 (UEK2), a problem has been seen during storage fault events where DM Multipath (DMMP) takes around 15 minutes to update the path status of Device Mapper (DM) devices (LUNs).
If you run the "multipath -ll" command during this interval, the path status is shown as "failed ready running" for that DM device (LUN). The path status is eventually updated as "active ready running."
This issue is seen with following version:
 Oracle Linux 6 Update 4:
 UEK2 Kernel: 2.6.39-400.17.1.el6uek.x86_64
 Multipath: device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el6.x86_64
 iSCSI: iscsi-initiator-utils-6.2.0.873-2.0.1.el6.x86_64

 Oracle Linux 5 Update 9:
 UEK2 Kernel: 2.6.39-400.17.1.el5uek
 Multipath: device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el5.x86_64
 iSCSI: iscsi-initiator-utils-6.2.0.872-16.0.1.el5.x86_64
| link:http://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13984[13984^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=739909[739909^] | The SG_IO ioctl system call fails on dm-multipath devices after an FC fault on OL6.x and OL5.x hosts with UEK2 | A problem is seen on Oracle Linux 6.x hosts with UEK2 kernel and Oracle Linux 5.x hosts with UEK2 kernel. The sg_* commands on a multipath device fail with EAGAIN error code (errno) after a fabric fault that makes all the paths in the active path group go down. This problem is seen only when there is no I/O occurring to the multipath devices.
 The following is an example:

 # sg_inq -v /dev/mapper/3600a098041764937303f436c75324370
     inquiry cdb: 12 00 00 00 24 00
 ioctl(SG_IO v3) failed with os_err (errno) = 11
 inquiry: pass through os error: Resource temporarily unavailable
 HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl failed:
         Resource temporarily unavailable [11]
 Both SCSI INQUIRY and fetching ATA information failed on /dev/mapper/3600a098041764937303f436c75324370
 #

 This problem occurs because the path group switchover to other active groups is not activated during ioctl() calls when no I/O is occurring on the DM-Multipath device. The problem has been observed on the following versions of the kernel-uek and device-mapper-multipath packages:

 OL6.4 versions:
 kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el6uek
 device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el6

 OL5.9 versions:
 kernel-uek-2.6.39-400.17.1.el5uek
 device-mapper-multipath-0.4.9-64.0.1.el5
