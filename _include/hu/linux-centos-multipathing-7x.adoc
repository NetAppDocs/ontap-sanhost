To ensure that multipathing is configured correctly for your host, verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file is defined and that you have the NetApp recommended settings configured for your ONTAP LUNs.

.Steps 

. Verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file exits. If the file doesn't exist, create an empty, zero-byte file:
+
[source,cli]
----
touch /etc/multipath.conf
----

. The first time the `multipath.conf` file is created, you might need to enable and start the multipath services to load the recommended settings: 
+
[source,cli]
----
chkconfig multipathd on
----
+
[source,cli]
----
/etc/init.d/multipathd start
----

. Each time you boot the host, the empty `/etc/multipath.conf` zero-byte file automatically loads the NetApp recommended host multipath parameters as the default settings. You shouldn't need to make changes to the `/etc/multipath.conf` file for your host because the operating system is compiled with the multipath parameters that recognize and manage ONTAP LUNs correctly.

The following table shows the Linux OS native compiled multipath parameter settings for ONTAP LUNs.

. Verify the parameter settings and path status for your ONTAP LUNs:
+
[source,cli]
----
multipath -ll
----
+
The default multipath parameters support ASA, AFF, and FAS configurations. In these configurations, a single ONTAP LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. If there are more than four paths, it might cause issues with the paths during a storage failure.
+
The following example outputs show the correct parameter settings and path status for ONTAP LUNs in an ASA, AFF, or FAS configuration.

.ASA configuration
--
An ASA configuration optimizes all paths to a given LUN, keeping them active. This improves performance by serving I/O operations through all paths at the same time.

.AFF or FAS configuration
--
An AFF or FAS configuration should have two groups of paths with higher and lower priorities. Higher priority Active/Optimized paths are served by the controller where the aggregate is located. Lower priority paths are active but non-optimized because they are served by a different controller. Non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths arenâ€™t available.

The following example displays the output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths:
