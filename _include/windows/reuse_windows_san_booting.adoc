. Map the SAN boot LUN to the host.
. Verify that multiple paths are available.

NOTE: Multiple paths only become available after the host OS is up and running on the paths.
. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped. For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.
. Reboot the host to verify the boot is successful.
