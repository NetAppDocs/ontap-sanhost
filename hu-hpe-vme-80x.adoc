The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a HPE VME 8.0.x host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 1: Install the Linux Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/install-linux-host-utilities-80.adoc[]

== Step 2: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with HPE VME 8.0.x to manage ONTAP LUNs.

To ensure that multipathing is configured correctly for your host, verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file is defined and that you have the NetApp recommended settings configured for your ONTAP LUNs.

.Steps 

. Verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file exits. If the file doesn't exist, create an empty, zero-byte file:
+
[source,cli]
----
touch /etc/multipath.conf
----

. The first time the `multipath.conf` file is created, you might need to enable and start the multipath services to load the recommended settings: 
+
[source,cli]
----
systemctl enable multipathd
----
+
[source,cli]
----
systemctl start multipathd
----

. Each time you boot the host, the empty `/etc/multipath.conf` zero-byte file automatically loads the NetApp recommended host multipath parameters as the default settings. You shouldn't need to make changes to the `/etc/multipath.conf` file for your host because the operating system is compiled with the multipath parameters that recognize and manage ONTAP LUNs correctly.
+
The following table shows the Linux OS native compiled multipath parameter settings for ONTAP LUNs.

. Verify the parameter settings and path status for your ONTAP LUNs:
+
[source,cli]
----
multipath -ll
----
+
The default multipath parameters support ASA, AFF, and FAS configurations. In these configurations, a single ONTAP LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. Having more than four paths can cause problems during a storage failure.
+
The following example outputs show the correct parameter settings and path status for ONTAP LUNs in an ASA, AFF, or FAS configuration.

=====
.ASA configuration
--
An ASA configuration optimizes all paths to a given LUN, keeping them active. This improves performance by serving I/O operations through all paths at the same time.

# multipath -ll

.AFF or FAS configuration
--
An AFF or FAS configuration should have two groups of paths with higher and lower priorities. Higher priority Active/Optimized paths are served by the controller where the aggregate is located. Lower priority paths are active but non-optimized because they are served by a different controller. Non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths aren’t available.

The following example displays the output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths:

  `- 16:0:2:0  sdcf 69:48  active ready running

== Step 3: Optionally, exclude a device from multipathing

If required, you can exclude a device from multipathing by adding the WWID for the unwanted device to the "blacklist" stanza for the `multipath.conf` file.

.Steps

. Determine the WWID:
+
[source,cli]
----
/lib/udev/scsi_id -gud /dev/sda
----
+
"sda" is the local SCSI disk that you want to add to the blacklist.
+
An example WWID is `360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833`.

. Add the WWID to the "blacklist" stanza:
+
[source,cli]
----
blacklist {
	     wwid   360030057024d0730239134810c0cb833
        devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
        devnode "^hd[a-z]"
        devnode "^cciss.*"
}
----

== Step 4: Customize multipath parameters for ONTAP LUNs

If your host is connected to LUNs from other vendors and any of the multipath parameter settings are overridden, you need to correct them by adding stanzas later in the `multipath.conf` file that apply specifically to ONTAP LUNs. If you don't do this, the ONTAP LUNs might not work as expected. 

Check your `/etc/multipath.conf` file, especially in the defaults section, for settings that might be overriding the <<multipath-parameter-settings,default settings for multipath parameters>>. 

CAUTION: You shouldn't override the recommended parameter settings for ONTAP LUNs. These settings are required for optimal performance of your host configuration. Contact NetApp support, your OS vendor, or both for more information.

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this example, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that aren't compatible with ONTAP LUNs, and you can't remove these parameters because ONTAP storage arrays are still attached to the host. Instead, you correct the values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` by adding a device stanza to the `multipath.conf` file that applies specifically to the ONTAP LUNs.
