You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure Oracle Linux 7.6 with ONTAP as the target.

== Install the Linux Unified Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_cloud_note.adoc[]

== SAN Toolkit

== SAN Booting

.What you'll need
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=86309;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux 7.6 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. Oracle Linux 7.6 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 path_checker tur
 detect_prio yes
 }
}

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| Bugzilla ID
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.

Remote ports with a "Not Present" state might cause paths to LUNs to become unavailable. During storage failover, the path redundancy might be reduced and result in an I/O outage.
You can check the remote port status by entering the following command:
# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state

The kernel panic causes Oracle Linux 7.6 to reboot, which leads to an application disruption.   If the kdump mechanism is enabled, the kernel panic generates a vmcore file located in the /var/crash/ directory. You can analyze the vmcore file to determine the cause of the panic.  After the kernel disruption, you can reboot the host OS and recover the operating system, and then you can restart any applications as required. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16606[16606^]

The storage failover operation reports change from an "online" state to a "blocked" state, causing a delay in read and write operations. After the operation has completed successfully, the reports fail to move back to an "online" state and continue to remain in a "blocked" state. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16852[16852^]

Because the logical interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote ports set the storage node status to blocked. IO progress might stop due to the blocked ports if you are running both a QLogic QLE2672 16G host and a QLE2742 32GB Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter (HBA).
When the storage node returns to its optimal state, the logical interfaces also come up and the remote ports should be online. However, the remote ports might still be blocked. This blocked state registers as failed faulty to LUNS at the multipath layer. You can verify the state of the remote ports with the following command:
 # cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_stat
 You should see the following output:
