The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on an Oracle Linux 7.6 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with Oracle Linux 7.6 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

NOTE: You can use the link:hu_rhel_76.html#rhel-rhck[recommended settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.6] to configure Red Hat Compatible Kernel for Oracle Linux 7.6.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The Oracle Linux 7.6 host with ONTAP storage has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device. To learn more, see  link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Flash_Storage/AFF_Series/The_filesystem_corruption_on_iSCSI_LUN_on_the_Oracle_Linux_7[NetApp Knowledge Base: The filesystem corruption on iSCSI LUN on the Oracle Linux 7^]. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1202736[1202736^] | LUNs might not be available during host discovery due to "Not Present" state of remote ports on a OL7U6 host with QLogic QLE2742 adapter |During host discovery, the status of Fibre Channel (FC) remote ports on a OL7U6 host with a QLogic QLE2742 adapter might enter into "Not Present" state. Remote ports with a "Not Present" state might cause paths to LUNs to become unavailable. During storage failover, the path redundancy might be reduced and result in an I/O outage.
You can check the remote port status by entering the following command:
# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state
The following is an example of the output that is displayed:

The kernel panic causes Oracle Linux 7.6 to reboot, which leads to an application disruption.   If the kdump mechanism is enabled, the kernel panic generates a vmcore file located in the /var/crash/ directory. You can analyze the vmcore file to determine the cause of the panic.  After the kernel disruption, you can reboot the host OS and recover the operating system, and then you can restart any applications as required.

The storage failover operation reports change from an "online" state to a "blocked" state, causing a delay in read and write operations. After the operation has completed successfully, the reports fail to move back to an "online" state and continue to remain in a "blocked" state.

Because the logical interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote ports set the storage node status to blocked. I/O progress might stop due to the blocked ports if you are running both a QLogic QLE2672 16G host and a QLE2742 32GB Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter (HBA).
When the storage node returns to its optimal state, the logical interfaces also come up and the remote ports should be online. However, the remote ports might still be blocked. This blocked state registers as failed faulty to LUNS at the multipath layer. You can verify the state of the remote ports with the following command:
 # cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_stat
 You should see the following output:
