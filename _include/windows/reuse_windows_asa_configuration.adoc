For All SAN Array (ASA) configuration, there should be one group of paths with single priorities. All  paths are Active/Optimized; that is, they are serviced by the controller and that the I/O is sent on all the active paths.

NOTE: Do not use an excessive number of paths to a single LUN. No more than four paths should be required. More than eight paths might cause path issues during storage failures.
