[.lead]
Rocky Linux 9.1 hosts support the NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP protocols with Asymmetric Namespace Access (ANA). ANA is equivalent to asymmetric logical unit access (ALUA) multipathing in iSCSI and FCP environments and is implemented using the in-kernel NVMe multipath feature.

For additional details on supported configurations, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

.About this task 
You can use the following support and features with the NVMe-oF host configuration for Rocky Linux 9.1. You should also review the known limitations before starting the configuration process.

* Support available:
** Support for NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) in addition to NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC). The NetApp plug-in in the native `nvme-cli` package displays ONTAP details for both NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP namespaces.
** Running NVMe and SCSI traffic on the same host. For example, you can configure dm-multipath for SCSI mpath devices for SCSI LUNs and use NVMe multipath to configure NVMe-oF namespace devices on the host.
* Features available:
** Rocky Linux 9.1 enables in-kernel NVMe multipath for NVMe namespaces by default, removing the need for explicit settings.
* Known limitations: 
** SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is currently not supported.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

== Step 2: Validate software versions
Use the following procedure to validate the minimum supported Rocky Linux 9.1 software versions.

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 9.1 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the specified Rocky Linux 9.1 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
The following example shows a Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64
----
[start=2]

== Step 4: Optionally, enable 1MB I/O

== Step 7: Review the known issues
The NVMe-oF host configuration for Rocky Linux 9.1 with ONTAP storage has the following known issue:

|NetApp Bug ID	|Title	|Description
|1503468
|`nvme list-subsys` command returns repeated NVMe controllers listed for a given subsystem	|The `nvme list-subsys` command should return a unique list of NVMe controllers associated with a given subsystem. In Rocky Linux 9.1, the `nvme list-subsys` command returns NVMe controllers with their respective ANA state for all namespaces that belong to a given subsystem. However, the ANA state is a per-namespace attribute, therefore, unique NVMe controller entries with the path state should be displayed if you list the subsystem command syntax for a given namespace.
