Configure Citrix Hypervisor 8.4 for multipathing and with specific parameters and settings for FCP and iSCSI protocol operation with ONTAP storage. 

[NOTE]
====
The Linux Host Utilities software package doesn’t support Citrix Hypervisor operating systems.

You don’t need to manually configure Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) settings because ONTAP LUNs are automatically mapped to the hypervisor.
