You must install multipath input/output (MPIO) software and have multipathing set up if your Windows host has more than one path to the storage system. Without MPIO software, the operating system might see each path as a separate disk, which can lead to data corruption. The MPIO software presents a single disk to the operating system for all paths, and a device-specific module (DSM) manages path failover.

On a Windows system, the two main components in any MPIO solution are the DSM and the Windows MPIO. MPIO is not supported for Windows XP or Windows Vista running in a Hyper-V virtual machine.
