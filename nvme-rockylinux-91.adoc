This document describes how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 9.1. For more support and feature information, see link:hu-nvme-index.html[NVME-oF Overview^]. The following are known limitations for Rocky Linux 9.1:

* SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is not currently supported.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

include::_include/nvme/enable-san-booting.adoc[]

== Step 2: Verify the software version and NVMe configuration

include::_include/nvme/verify-software-version-introduction.adoc[]

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 9.1 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the required Rocky Linux 9.1 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
Example Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64

== Step 3: Configure NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP

include::_include/nvme/nvme-configure.adoc[]

== Step 4: Optionally, enable 1MB I/O for NVMe/FC

include::_include/nvme/nvme-enable-1mb-io.adoc[]

== Step 5: Verify the multipathing configuration

|`nvme list-subsys` command returns repeated NVMe controllers listed for a given subsystem	|The `nvme list-subsys` command should return a unique list of NVMe controllers associated with a given subsystem. In Rocky Linux 9.1, the `nvme list-subsys` command returns NVMe controllers with their respective ANA state for all namespaces that belong to a given subsystem. However, the ANA state is a per-namespace attribute, therefore, unique NVMe controller entries with the path state should be displayed if you list the subsystem command syntax for a given namespace.
