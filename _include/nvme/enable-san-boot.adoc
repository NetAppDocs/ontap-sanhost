== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

You can configure your host to use SAN booting to simplify deployment and improve scalability.

.Before you begin
Use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Linux OS, host bus adapter (HBA), HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.

.Steps

. Create a SAN boot namespace and map it to the host.
+
See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-admin/create-nvme-namespace-subsystem-task.html[Provision NVMe storage^].
. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot namespace is mapped.
+
For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.

. Verify that the configuration was successful by rebooting the host and verifying that the OS is up and running.
