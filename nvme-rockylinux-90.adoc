Learn how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 9.0. For more support and feature information, see link:nvme-rockylinux-overview.html[Rocky Linux ONTAP support and features].

*NVMe-oF with Rocky Linux 9.0 has the following known limitations:*

* SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is not currently supported.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 9.0 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the required Rocky Linux 9.0 kernel:
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
Example Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64

== Step 3: Configure NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP

include::_include/nvme/nvme-configure.adoc[]

== Step 4: Optionally, enable 1MB I/O for NVMe/FC

|link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/HOSTUTILITIES/BURT/1479047[1479047^]	|Rocky Linux 9.0 NVMe-oF hosts create duplicate Persistent Discovery Controllers	|On NVMe-oF hosts, you can use the "nvme discover -p" command to create Persistent Discovery Controllers (PDCs). When this command is used, only one PDC should be created per initiator-target combination. However, if you are running ONTAP 9.10.1 and Rocky Linux 9.0 with an NVMe-oF host, a duplicate PDC is created each time "nvme discover -p" is executed. This leads to unnecessary usage of resources on both the host and the target.
