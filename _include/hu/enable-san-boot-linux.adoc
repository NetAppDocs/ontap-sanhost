If it is supported by your SAN configuration, you should configure your host to use SAN booting to simplify deployment and improve scalability.

.Before you begin
Use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Linux OS, host bus adapter (HBA), HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.

.Steps

. Map the SAN boot LUN to the host.
+
See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-management/index.html[SAN storage management^].
. Verify that multiple paths are available.
+
[NOTE] 
Multiple paths become available after the host OS is up and running on the paths.

. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped.
+
For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.

. Reboot the host to verify that the boot was successful.
