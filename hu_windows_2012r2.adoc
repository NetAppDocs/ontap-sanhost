== Multipathing

You need to install the Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) software and enable multipathing if your Windows host has more than one path to the storage system. When you select MPIO support, the Windows Host Utilities enables the MPIO feature included in Windows Server 2012 R2. If you're not using the Windows Host Utilities, you need to enable multipathing manually.
