== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

You can configure your host to use SAN booting to simplify deployment and improve scalability.

.Before you begin
Use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Linux OS, host bus adapter (HBA), HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.

.About this task
SAN booting is the process of setting up a SAN-attached disk (a LUN) as a boot device for a Solaris host.

You can set up a SAN boot LUN to work in a Solaris MPxIO environment using the FC protocol and running Solaris Host Utilities. The method you use to set up a SAN boot LUN can vary depending on your volume manager and file system. See link:hu_solaris_62.html[Install Solaris Host Utilities] for details on a SAN boot LUNs in a Solaris MPIO (Microsoft Multipath I/O) environment.
