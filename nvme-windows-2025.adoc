You can configure NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) on hosts running Windows Server 2025 for operation with ONTAP LUNs.

.About this task
You can use the following support with the NVMe/FC host configuration for Windows 2025. You should also review the known limitations before starting the configuration process.

* Support available:
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, NVMe/FC is supported for Windows Server 2025.

* Known limitations:
+
Windows Failover Cluster (WFC) isn't supported with NVMe/FC because ONTAP doesn't currently support persistent reservations with NVMe/FC.
+
NOTE: Broadcom ships an external driver for Windows NVMe/FC that is a translational SCSI â‡„ NVMe driver and not a true NVMe/FC driver. The translational overhead doesn't necessarily impact performance, but it does negate the performance benefits of NVMe/FC. As a result,  NVMe/FC and FCP performance is the same on Windows servers, unlike other operating systems such as Linux, where NVMe/FC performance is significantly better than that of FCP.
