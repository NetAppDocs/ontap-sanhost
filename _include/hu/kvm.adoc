* Learn about Linux KVM and Virtualization
+
Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) allows you to run multiple virtual machines on a single host. With ONTAP storage, LUNs can be presented directly to the KVM hypervisor over FCP or iSCSI, providing high-performance and reliable storage for your VMs. You don't need to manually configure Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) settings because ONTAP LUNs are automatically mapped to the hypervisor. You can use ONTAP features such as snapshots and cloning at the LUN or volume level; for per-VM granularity, LUNs must be mapped directly to individual VMs using techniques like raw device mapping or passthrough.
