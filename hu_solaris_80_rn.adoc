For specific information about the operating system versions and updates that the Host Utilities support, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

== What's new

. Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 introduces setting of  two parameters `disksort:false` and `cache-nonvolatile:true`, which will suppress constant sync() calls from the host that interfered with performance. As ONTAP doesn't have volatile cache, they're unnecessary calls that impacts on prformance. Additional details available at test link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/solaris/oracle-solaris/11.4/tuning/ensuring-proper-cache-flush-behavior-flash-and-nvram-storage-devices.html[Cache Flush Behavior for Flash and NVRAM Storage Devices].
. Also Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 facilitate with automated update of FC driver binding parameters that changed from ssd(4D) to sd(4D). The FC driver binding for Solaris 11.4 is changed from ssd(4D) to sd(4D), as refer link:https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2595926_1.html[Oracle Doc ID 2595926.1].
. Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 release will be supporting only Solaris 11.4 with both Sparc and x86 platforms. Solaris 11.3 and earlier versions should  use the Solaris Host Utilities 6.2.
