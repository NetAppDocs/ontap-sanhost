* `installer` is the name of the `.msi` file for your CPU architecture.
* MULTIPATHING specifies whether Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) support is installed. The allowed values are "0" for no and "1" for yes.
* `inst_path` is the path where the Host Utilities files are installed. The default path is `C:\Program Files\NetApp\Windows Host Utilities\`.

[NOTE]
To see the standard Microsoft Installer (MSI) options for logging and other functions, enter `msiexec /help` at the Windows command prompt. For example, the `msiexec /i install.msi /quiet /l*v <install.log> LOGVERBOSE=1` command displays logging information.

The system automatically reboots when the installation is complete.
