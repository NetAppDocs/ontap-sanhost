The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.1 host, you can use the Host Utilities to support managing FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 2: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 8.1 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

The kernel disruption causes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 to reboot, leading to application disruption. If the kdump mechanism is enabled, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file located in the/var/crash/ directory. You can check the vmcore file to determine the cause of the disruption.A storage failover with the QLogic QLE2672 HBA event affects the "kmem_cache_alloc+131" module. You can locate the event in the vmcore file by finding the following string: " [exception RIP: kmem_cache_alloc+131]"After the kernel disruption, reboot the Host OS and recover the operating system. Then restart the applications
