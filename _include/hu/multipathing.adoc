To ensure that multipathing is configured correctly for your host, verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file is defined and that you have the NetApp recommended settings configured for your ONTAP LUNs.

.Steps 

. Verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file exits. If the file doesn't exist, create an empty, zero-byte file:
+
[source,cli]
----
touch /etc/multipath.conf
----

. The first time the `multipath.conf` file is created, you might need to enable and start the multipath services: 
+
[source,cli]
----
systemctl enable multipathd
----
+
[source,cli]
----
systemctl start multipathd
----

. When you boot the host, the empty `/etc/multipath.conf` zero-byte file automatically loads the NetApp recommended host multipath parameters as the default settings. 
+
The following table shows the critical multipath parameter settings for ONTAP LUNs.

You shouldn't need to make changes to the `/etc/multipath.conf` file for your host because the operating system is compiled with the multipath parameters that recognize and manage ONTAP LUNs correctly.

. Verify the settings for your ONTAP LUNs:
+
[source,cli]
----
multipath -ll
----
+
The default multipath parameters support ASA and non-ASA configurations. In both configurations, a single ONTAP LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. If there are more than four paths, it might cause issues with the paths during a storage failure.
+
The following example outputs show the correct settings for ONTAP LUNs for an ASA and non-ASA configuration.

.ASA configuration
--
An ASA configuration optimizes all paths to a given LUN, keeping them active. This improves performance by serving I/O operations through all paths at the same time.

.Non-ASA configuration
--
For non-ASA configurations, there should be two groups of paths with higher and lower priorities. Higher priority Active/Optimized paths are served by the controller where the aggregate is located. Lower priority paths are active but non-optimized because they are served by a different controller. Non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths arenâ€™t available.

The following example displays the output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths:
