A non-ASA configuration should have two groups of paths with different priorities. The paths with higher priorities are Active/Optimized. This means the Active/Optimized paths are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located. The paths with lower priorities are active but non-optimized because they are served from a different controller. The non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths aren't available.

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two active/non-optimized paths.
