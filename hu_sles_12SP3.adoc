[.lead]
You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 with ONTAP as the target. 

== Install the Linux Unified Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_cloud_note.adoc[]

== SAN Toolkit

== SAN Booting

.What you'll need
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=80043;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

 path_checker readsector0
 no_path_retry fail
}
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 no_path_retry queue

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1089555[1089555^] | Kernel disruption observed on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 16GB FC during storage failover operation | A kernel disruption might occur during storage failover operations on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 HBA. The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module “lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51.

Recover the operating system after the kernel disruption by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application. | link:http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1042847[1042847^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1089561[1089561^] | Kernel disruption observed on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe32002 32GB FC during storage failover operations | A kernel disruption might occur during storage failover operations on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe32002 HBA. The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module
“lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76.

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1117248[1117248^] | Kernel disruption observed on SLES12SP3 with QLogic QLE2562 8GB FC during storage failover operations |  During storage failover operations on the Sles12sp3 kernel (kernel-default-4.4.82-6.3.1) with QLogic QLE2562 HBA, the kernel disruption was observed due to a panic in the kernel. The kernel panic leads to a reboot of the operating system, causing an application disruption. The kernel panic generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. Upon the kernel panic, the vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case, the panic was observed in the “blk_finish_request+289” module.
It is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:
"exception RIP: blk_finish_request+289"

After the kernel disruption, you can recover the operating system  by rebooting the Host OS. You can restart the application as required. | link:http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1062496[1062496^]

This prompts a reboot of the operating system causing application disruption. The kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case the Kernel disruption was observed in the module "unknown or invalid address" and is logged in vmcore file with the following string - exception RIP: unknown or invalid address.

After kernel disruption, the operating system can be recovered by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application as required. | link:http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1062508[1062508^]

This prompts a reboot of the operating system causing application disruption. The kernel disruption
generates a vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file can be used to understand the cause
of the failure.
Example:
In this case kernel disruption was observed in the module “raw_spin_lock_irqsave+30” and is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:
– exception RIP: _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+30.
