Unlike NVMe/FC, NVMe/TCP has no auto-connect functionality. This manifests two major limitations on the Linux NVMe/TCP host:

* *No auto-reconnect after paths get reinstated* - NVMe/TCP cannot automatically reconnect to a path that is reinstated beyond the default `ctrl-loss-tmo` timer of 10 minutes following a path down.

* *No auto-connect during host boot* - NVMe/TCP cannot connect automatically during host boot.

You should set the retry period for failover events to at least 30 minutes to prevent timeouts. You can increase the retry period by increasing the value of the `ctrl_loss_tmo` timer using the following procedure:
