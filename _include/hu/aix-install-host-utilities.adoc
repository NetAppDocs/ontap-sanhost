== Step 2: Install the Solaris Host Utilities

NetApp strongly recommends installing the AIX Host Utilities to support ONTAP LUN management and assist technical support with gathering configuration data. The MPIO package from the Host Utilities provides MPIO support for AIX and VIOS. 

NOTE: Installing the AIX Host Utilities provides additional timeout settings on your AIX host.
