| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.
