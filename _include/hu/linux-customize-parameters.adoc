== Step 5: Customize multipath parameters for ONTAP LUNs

If your host is connected to LUNs from other vendors and any of the multipath parameter settings are overridden, you need to correct them by adding stanzas later in the `multipath.conf` file that apply specifically to ONTAP LUNs. If you don't do this, the ONTAP LUNs might not work as expected. 

Check your `/etc/multipath.conf` file, especially in the defaults section, for settings that might be overriding the <<multipath-parameter-settings,default settings for multipath parameters>>. 

CAUTION: You shouldn't override the recommended parameter settings for ONTAP LUNs. These settings are required for optimal performance of your host configuration. Contact NetApp support, your OS vendor, or both for more information.

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this example, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that aren't compatible with ONTAP LUNs, and you can't remove these parameters because ONTAP storage arrays are still attached to the host. Instead, you correct the values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` by adding a device stanza to the `multipath.conf` file that applies specifically to the ONTAP LUNs.
