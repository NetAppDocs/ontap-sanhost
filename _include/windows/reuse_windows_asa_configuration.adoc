For All SAN Array (ASA) configuration, there should be one group of paths with single priorities. All paths are active/optimized; that is, they are serviced by the controller and that the I/O is sent on all the active paths.

NOTE: A single LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. Having more than four paths might cause path issues during storage failures.
