You can configure supported SAN hosts to use the NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) protocol with ONTAP as the storage target. NVMe-oF includes NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) and NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP). Depending on your host operating system and ONTAP version, you configure and validate the NVMe/FC or NVMe/TCP protocol, or both on the host.

== ONTAP support and features

The following table shows the ONTAP support and features and the SAN host versions for NVMe configurations:
