You can boot the Windows OS using a local boot or a SAN boot. NetApp recommends using a SAN boot if it is supported by your configuration.

====
.Local boot
--
Perform a local boot by installing the Windows OS on the local hard disk (SSD, SATA, RAID, and so on).
--

.SAN boot
--
If you opt to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration.

.Before you begin
Use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Windows OS, host bus adapter (HBA), HBA firmware, HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.

.Steps
. Map the SAN boot LUN to the host.
+
See link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/san-management/index.html[SAN storage management^].
. Verify that multiple paths are available. 
+
NOTE: Multiple paths only become available after the host OS is up and running on the paths.
. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped. 
+
For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.
. Reboot the host to verify the boot was successful
