[.lead]
You can use the ONTAP SAN host configuration settings to configure Oracle Linux 7.5 with ONTAP as the target.

== Install the Linux Host Utilities

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_cloud_note.adoc[]

== SAN Toolkit

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_toolkit.adoc[]

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux 7.5 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. Oracle Linux 7.5 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 7.5 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs.
If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 path_checker tur
 detect_prio yes
 }
}

== Known issues

The Oracle Linux 7.5 with ONTAP release has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device. To learn more, see  link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Flash_Storage/AFF_Series/The_filesystem_corruption_on_iSCSI_LUN_on_the_Oracle_Linux_7[NetApp Knowledge Base: The filesystem corruption on iSCSI LUN on the Oracle Linux 7^]. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1177239[1177239^] | Kernel disruption observed on OL7.5 with Qlogic QLE2672 16G FC during storage failover operations |During storage failover operations on Oracle Linux 7 (OL7.5) with kernel 4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.x86_64 and the Qlogic QLE2672 HBA, you might observe kernel disruption. This prompts a reboot of the operating system which causes an application disruption.
If kdump is configured, the kernel disruption creates a vmcore file in the  /var/crash/ directory. This disruption can be observed in the module “kmem_cache_alloc+118,” which is logged in the vmcore file and identified with the string "exception RIP: kmem_cache_alloc+118."
After a kernel disruption, you can recover by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application.
