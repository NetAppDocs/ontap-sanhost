== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=68625;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux 7.0 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. Oracle Linux 7.0 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs. To Enable ALUA Handler, perform the following steps:

.	Create a backup of the initrd-image.
.	Append the following parameter value to the kernel for ALUA and non-ALUA to work:
`rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua`
+
.Example
....
kernel /vmlinuz-3.8.13-68.1.2.el6uek.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_ibmx3550m421096-lv_root rd_NO_LUKSrd_LVM_LV=vg_ibmx3550m421096/lv_root LANG=en_US.UTF-8 rd_NO_MDSYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 crashkernel=256M KEYBOARDTYPE=pc KEYTABLE=us rd_LVM_LV=vg_ibmx3550m421096/lv_swap rd_NO_DM rhgb quiet rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua
....
.	Recreate the initrd-image with the `dracut -f` command.
.	Reboot the host.
.	Verify the output of the `cat /proc/cmdline` command to ensure that the setting is complete.

== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 7.0 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs.
If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 path_checker tur
 detect_prio yes
 }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=901558[901558^] | OL7.0 : Host loses all paths to the lun and hangs due to "RSCN timeout" error on OL 7.0 UEK r3U5 Beta on Emulex 8G(LPe12002) host | You might observe that the Emulex 8G(LPe12002) host hangs and there is a high I/O outage during storage failover operations with I/O. You might observe paths not recovering, which is a result of the RSCN timeout, due to which the host loses all the paths and hangs. Probability of hitting this issue is high. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14898[14898^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=901557[901557^] | OL 7.0: High IO outage observed on QLogic 8G FC (QLE2562) SAN host during storage failover operations with IO | You might observe high IO outage on QLogic 8G FC (QLE2562) host during storage failover operations with IO. Aborts and Device resets manifests as IO outage on the host. Probability of hitting this IO outage is high. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14894[14894^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894766[894766^] |  OL7.0: Dracut fails to include scsi_dh_alua.ko module in initramfs on UEKR3U5 alpha | The scsi_dh_alua module might not load even after adding the parameter "rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua" in the kernel command line and creating Dracut. As a result, ALUA is not enabled for NetApp LUNs as recommended. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14860[14860^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894796[894796^] | Anaconda displays an iSCSI login failure message although logins are successful during OL 7.0 OS installation |  When you are installing OL 7.0, the anaconda installation screen displays that iSCSI login to multiple target IPs have failed though the iSCSI logins are successful. Anaconda displays following error message:
 "Node Login Failed"
 You will observe this error only when you select multiple target IPs for iSCSI login.
 You can continue the OS installation by clicking the "ok" button. This bug does not hamper either the iSCSI or the OL 7.0 OS installation. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14870[14870^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=894771[894771^] | OL7.0 : Anaconda does not add bootdev argument in kernel cmd line to set IP address for iSCSI SANboot OS install | Anaconda does not add a bootdev argument in the kernel command line where you set the IPv4 address during the OL 7.0 OS installation on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN. Owing to this, you cannot assign IP addresses to any of the Ethernet interfaces that were configured to establish iSCSI sessions with the storage subsystem during the OL 7.0 boot. Since iSCSI sessions are not established, the root LUN is not discovered when the OS boots and hence the OS boot fails. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14871[14871^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=916501[916501^] |	Qlogic 10G FCoE (QLE8152) host kernel crash observed during storage failover operations with IO | You may observe a kernel crash in Qlogic driver module on 10G FCoE Qlogic (QLE8152) host. The crash occurs during storage failover operations with IO. Probability of hitting this crash is high which leads to longer IO outage on the host. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15019[15019^]
