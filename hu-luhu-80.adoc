[.lead]
The Linux Host Utilities assists you to manage ONTAP storage attached to a Linux host. NetApp strongly recommends installing the Linux Host Utilities, but it isn't mandatory. The utilities don't change any settings on your Linux host. The utilities improve management and assist NetApp customer support in gathering information about your configuration. 

The following Linux distributions are supported:

*	Red Hat Enterprise Linux
*	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
*	Oracle Linux
*	Oracle VM

NOTE: The Linux Host Utilities software doesn't support NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) and NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) host protocols.

.About this task

The NetApp Linux Host Utilities software package is available on the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/hostutilities/downloads-tab/download/61343/7.1/downloads[NetApp Support Site^] in a 64-bit .rpm file. 

.Before you begin
* For reliable operation, use the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify your iSCSI, FC, or FCoE configuration is supported.
* Install the host bus adapter (HBA) management packages available on the vendor support site.
+
The management software enables the SAN Toolkit commands to gather information about the FC HBAs, such as their WWPNs. For the `sanlun fcp show adapter` command to work, verify that the following packages are correctly installed:
+
** Marvell QLogic HBA â€“ QConvergeConsole CLI
** Broadcom Emulex HBA - OneCommand Manager core application CLI

.Steps

. If you have a version of Linux Host Utilities currently installed, remove it:
+
[source, cli]
----
rpm -e netapp_linux_unified_host_utilities-8-0
----
+
For earlier versions of Linux Host Utilities, go to the directory where the host utility software is installed and enter the uninstall command to remove the installed package.

. Download the 64-bit Linux Host Utilities software package from the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/hostutilities/downloads-tab/download/61343/7.1/downloads[NetApp Support Site^] to your host.

. Go to the directory to which you downloaded the software package and install it:
+
[source, cli]
----
rpm -ivh netapp_linux_unified_host_utilities-7-1.x86_xx.rpm
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to link to the HBA library for an Ubuntu host OS:

[source, cli]
----
cp /opt/QLogic_Corporation/QConvergeConsoleCLI/lib64/libHBAAPI.so.2.0.2 /usr/lib64/libHBAAPI.so`
----
====
. Verify the installation:
+
[source, cli]
----
sanlun version
----
+
----
sanlun version 7.1.386.1644

== What's next?

* Use the recommended driver settings with Linux kernel:
+
When you configure an FC environment that uses native inbox drivers that are bundled with the Linux kernel, you can use the default values for the drivers.
