.UEK 3
--
The settings for Oracle Linux UEK 3 with and without ALUA update automatically. After the settings update, you need to enable "ALUA Handler":

. Create a backup of the initrd-image.

. Append the following parameter value to the kernel for ALUA and non-ALUA to work:
+
[source,cli]
----
rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua
----
+
.Example output

kernel /vmlinuz-3.8.13-68.1.2.el6uek.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_ibmx3550m421096-lv_root rd_NO_LUKSrd_LVM_LV=vg_ibmx3550m421096/lv_root LANG=en_US.UTF-8 rd_NO_MDSYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 crashkernel=256M KEYBOARDTYPE=pc KEYTABLE=us rd_LVM_LV=vg_ibmx3550m421096/lv_swap rd_NO_DM rhgb quiet rdloaddriver=scsi_dh_alua
----
. Recreate the initrd-image:
+
[source,cli]
----
dracut -f
----

. Reboot the host.
. Review the output of the `cat /proc/cmdline` command to verify that the setting is complete.

.UEK 4
--
For Oracle Linux UEK 4, verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file is defined and that the NetApp recommended settings are configured for your ONTAP LUNs.

. Verify that the `/etc/multipath.conf` file exits. If the file doesn't exist, create an empty, zero-byte file:
+
[source,cli]
----
touch /etc/multipath.conf
----

. The first time the `multipath.conf` file is created, you might need to enable and start the multipath services to load the recommended settings: 
+
[source,cli]
----
chkconfig multipathd on
----
+
[source,cli]
----
/etc/init.d/multipathd start
----

. Each time you boot the host, the empty `/etc/multipath.conf` zero-byte file automatically loads the NetApp recommended host multipath parameters as the default settings. You shouldn't need to make changes to the `/etc/multipath.conf` file for your host because the operating system is compiled with the multipath parameters that recognize and manage ONTAP LUNs correctly.

. Verify the parameter settings and path status for your ONTAP LUNs:
+
[source,cli]
----
multipath -ll
----
+
The default multipath parameters support AFF and FAS configurations. In these configurations, a single ONTAP LUN shouldn't require more than four paths. If there are more than four paths, it might cause issues with the paths during a storage failure.
+
An AFF or FAS configuration should have two groups of paths with higher and lower priorities. Higher priority Active/Optimized paths are served by the controller where the aggregate is located. Lower priority paths are active but non-optimized because they are served by a different controller. Non-optimized paths are only used when optimized paths arenâ€™t available.
+
The following example outputs show the correct parameter settings and path status for ONTAP LUNs in an AFF or FAS configuration with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths:
