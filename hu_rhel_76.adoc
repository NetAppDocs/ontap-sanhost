The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.6 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 7.6 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The RHEL 7.6 with ONTAP storage release has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.

These blocked remote ports might result in the paths to LUNs becoming unavailable. During storage failover, the path redundancy might be reduced and result in I/O outage. You can check the remote port status by entering the following command:# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state

Because the logical interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote ports set the storage node status to blocked. When the storage node returns to its optimal state, the logical interfaces also come up and the remote ports should be online. However, the remote portsmight still be blocked. This blocked state registers as failed faulty to LUNS at the multipath layer. You can verify the remote ports state with the following command:# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state
