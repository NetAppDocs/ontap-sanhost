Note that the Broadcom initiator can serve both NVMe/FC and FCP traffic through the same 32G FC adapter ports. For FCP and FC/NVMe, use MSDSM as the Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) option.

See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/Home/Index[Hardware Universe] for a list of supported FC adapters and controllers. For the most current list of supported configurations & versions, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[NetApp Interoperability Matrix].
