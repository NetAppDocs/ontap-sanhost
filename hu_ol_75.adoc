The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on an Oracle Linux 7.5 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with Oracle Linux 7.5 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

NOTE: You can use the link:hu_rhel_75.html#rhel-rhck[recommended settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.5] to configure Red Hat Compatible Kernel for Oracle Linux 7.5.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The Oracle Linux 7.5 host with ONTAP storage has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device. To learn more, see  link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Flash_Storage/AFF_Series/The_filesystem_corruption_on_iSCSI_LUN_on_the_Oracle_Linux_7[NetApp Knowledge Base: The filesystem corruption on iSCSI LUN on the Oracle Linux 7^]. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1177239[1177239^] | Kernel disruption observed on OL7.5 with Qlogic QLE2672 16G FC during storage failover operations |During storage failover operations on Oracle Linux 7 (OL7.5) with kernel 4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.x86_64 and the Qlogic QLE2672 HBA, you might observe kernel disruption. This prompts a reboot of the operating system which causes an application disruption.
If kdump is configured, the kernel disruption creates a vmcore file in the  /var/crash/ directory. This disruption can be observed in the module “kmem_cache_alloc+118,” which is logged in the vmcore file and identified with the string "exception RIP: kmem_cache_alloc+118."
After a kernel disruption, you can recover by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application.
