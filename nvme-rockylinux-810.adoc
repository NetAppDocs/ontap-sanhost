Learn how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 8.10. For more support and feature information, see link:hu-nvme-index.html[NVME-oF Overview^]. 

*NVMe-oF with Rocky Linux 8.10 has the following known limitations:*

* SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is not currently supported.
* In-kernel NVMe multipath is disabled by default on NVMe-oF hosts in Rocky Linux 8.10; you must enable it manually.
* NVMe/TCP is available as a technology preview due to known issues.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 8.10 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the required Rocky Linux 8.10 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r
----
+
Example Rocky Linux kernel version:
+
----
5.14.0-570.12.1.el9_6.x86_64

|link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/HOSTUTILITIES/BURT/1479047[1479047^]	|Rocky Linux 8.10 NVMe-oF hosts create duplicate persistent discovery controllers	|On NVMe-oF hosts, you can use the "nvme discover -p" command to create Persistent Discovery Controllers (PDCs). When this command is used, only one PDC should be created per initiator-target combination. However, if you are running Rocky Linux 8.10 on an NVMe-oF host, a duplicate PDC is created each time "nvme discover -p" is executed. This leads to unnecessary usage of resources on both the host and the target.
