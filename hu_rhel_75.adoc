The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.5 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 7.5 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 6: Review the known issues

The RHEL 7.5 with ONTAP storage release has the following known issues:

| NetApp Bug ID
| Title
| Description
| 1440718 | If you unmap or map a LUN without performing a SCSI rescan, it might lead to data corruption on the host. | When you set the 'disable_changed_wwids' multipath configuration parameter to YES, it disables access to the path device in the event of a WWID change. Multipath will disable access to the path device until the WWID of the path is restored to the WWID of the multipath device.

The kernel panic causes RHEL 7.5 to reboot, which leads to an application disruption. The kernel panic generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file is used to understand the cause of the failure. In this case, the panic was observed in the “get_next_timer_interrupt+440” module which is logged in the vmcore file with the following string: " [exception RIP: get_next_timer_interrupt+440]" After the kernel disruption, you can recover the operating system by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application as required.

The kernel panic leads to a reboot of the operating system, causing an application disruption. The kernel panic generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. When the kernel panics, you can use the vmcore file to investigate the reason for the failure. The following example shows a panic in the bget_next_timer_interrupt+440b module. The panic is logged in the vmcore file with the following string: " [exception RIP: get_next_timer_interrupt+440]" You can recover the operating system by rebooting the host OS and restarting the application as required. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1148090[1148090^] | Kernel disruption occurs on RHEL 7.5 with QLogic QLE2742 32GB FC HBA during storage failover operations | During storage failover operations on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.5 kernel with a QLogic QLE2742 Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter (HBA), a kernel disruption occurs due to a panic in the kernel. The kernel panic causes RHEL 7.5 to reboot, which leads to an application disruption. If the kdump mechanism is enabled, the kernel panic generates a vmcore file located in the /var/crash/ directory. You can analyze the vmcore file to determine the cause of the panic.  In this instance, when storage failover with the QLogic QLE2742 HBA event occurs, the "native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+464" module is affected. You can locate the event in the vmcore file by finding the following string:     " [exception RIP: native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+464]"  After the kernel disruption, you can reboot the Host OS and recover the operating system, and then you can restart the applications as required. 
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1146898[1146898^] | Kernel disruption occurs on RHEL 7.5 with Emulex HBAs during storage failover operations | During storage failover operations on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.5 system with Emulex LPe32002-M2 32-GB FC host bus adapters (HBAs), a disruption in the kernel occurs. The kernel disruption causes a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption.  If you configure kdump, the kernel disruption generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory. You can use the vmcore file to determine the cause of the failure. In the following example, you can see the disruption in the "lpfc_hba_clean_txcmplq+368" module. This disruption is logged in the vmcore file with the following string: " [exception RIP: lpfc_hba_clean_txcmplq+368]" After the kernel disruption, reboot the host OS to recover the operating system. Restart the application as required.
