For non-ASA configuration there should be two groups of paths with different priorities.

The paths with the higher priorities are Active/Optimized, meaning they are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located.

The paths with the lower priorities are active but are non-optimized because they are served from a different controller.

NOTE: The non-optimized paths are only used when no optimized paths are available.

.Example

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two active/optimized paths and two active/non-optimized paths.
