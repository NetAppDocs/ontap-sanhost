If you opt to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

. Map the SAN boot LUN to the host.
. Verify multiple paths are available. Remember, multiple paths will only be available after the host OS is up and running on the paths.
. Enable SAN booting in the server BIOS for the ports to which the SAN boot LUN is mapped. For information on how to enable the HBA BIOS, see your vendor-specific documentation.
. Reboot the host to verify the boot is successful.
