The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on an Oracle Linux 8.10 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.
