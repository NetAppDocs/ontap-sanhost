Linux Host Utilities 8.0 supports the following distribution types:

*	Red Hat Enterprise Linux
*	SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
*	Oracle Linux
*	Oracle VM

NOTE: The Linux Host Utilities software doesn't support NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) and NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) host protocols.

.About this task

* The NetApp Linux Host Utilities software package is available on the NetApp Support Site in a 64-bit .rpm file.
* When you install the Linux Host Utilities, it doesn't change any settings on your Linux host. 

.Before you begin
* For reliable operation, use the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your iSCSI, FC, or FCoE configuration is supported.
* Install the host bus adapter (HBA) management packages available on the vendor support site.
+
The management software enables the `sanlun` commands to gather information about the FC HBAs, such as their WWPNs. For the `sanlun fcp show adapter` command to work, verify that the following packages are correctly installed:
+
** Marvell QLogic HBA â€“ QConvergeConsole CLI
** Broadcom Emulex HBA - OneCommand Manager core application CLI
