.About this task 
You can use the following support and features with the NVMe-oF host configuration for Rocky Linux 9.0. You should also review the known limitations before starting the configuration process.

* Support available:
** Support for NVMe over TCP (NVMe/TCP) in addition to NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC). The NetApp plug-in in the native `nvme-cli` package displays ONTAP details for both NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP namespaces.
** Running NVMe and SCSI traffic on the same host. For example, you can configure dm-multipath for SCSI mpath devices for SCSI LUNs and use NVMe multipath to configure NVMe-oF namespace devices on the host.

For additional details on supported configurations, see the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].
* Features available:
** Rocky Linux 9.0 enables in-kernel NVMe multipath for NVMe namespaces by default, removing the need for explicit settings.
* Known limitations: 
** SAN booting using the NVMe-oF protocol is currently not supported.

|link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/HOSTUTILITIES/BURT/1479047[1479047^]	|Rocky Linux 9.0 NVMe-oF hosts create duplicate Persistent Discovery Controllers	|On NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts, you can use the "nvme discover -p" command to create Persistent Discovery Controllers (PDCs). When this command is used, only one PDC should be created per initiator-target combination.  However, if you are running ONTAP 9.10.1 and Rocky Linux 9.0 with an NVMe-oF host, a duplicate PDC is created each time "nvme discover -p" is executed. This leads to unnecessary usage of resources on both the host and the target.
