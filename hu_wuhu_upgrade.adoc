You can perform a quiet (unattended) upgrade of the new host utilities by entering the appropriate commands at the Windows command prompt.

The new host utilities installation package must be in a path that is accessible by the Windows host. Follow the instructions for installing the host utilities interactively to upgrade the installation package.

.Steps

. Enter the following command at the Windows command prompt:
+
`msiexec /i installer.msi /quiet MULTIPATHING= {0 | 1} [INSTALLDIR=inst_path]`

* `installer` is the name of the `.msi` file for your CPU architecture.
* MULTIPATHING specifies whether MPIO support is installed. The allowed values are "0" for no and "1" for yes.
* `inst_path` is the path where the host utilities files are installed. The default path is `C:\Program Files\NetApp\Windows Host Utilities\`.

[NOTE]
To see the standard Microsoft Installer (MSI) options for logging and other functions, enter `msiexec /help` at the Windows command prompt. For example, the `msiexec /i install.msi /quiet /l*v <install.log> LOGVERBOSE=1` command displays logging information.

The system automatically reboots when the installation is complete.
