This content provides host and version specific best practices to quickly configure SAN hosts connected to ONTAP storage.  

Your SAN hosts and ONTAP storage can reside either on-premises, in the cloud, or both.  

NOTE: In a cloud environment, hosts are typically referred to as clients. All host specific information in this content also applies to cloud clients.

For example you can configure on-premises ONTAP storage to connect to on-premises SAN hosts or to connect to SAN cloud clients.  You could also configure link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/index.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP^] or link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-fsx-ontap/index.html[Amazon FSx for ONTAP^] to connect to on-premises SAN hosts or to connect to SAN cloud clients.

Proper configuration is important for best performance and successful failover.
