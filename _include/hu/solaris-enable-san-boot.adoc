SAN booting is the process of setting up a SAN-attached disk (a LUN) as a boot device for a Solaris host. You can set up a SAN boot LUN to work in a Solaris MPxIO environment that is using the FC protocol and running Solaris Host Utilities. The method you use to set up a SAN boot LUN depends on your volume manager and file system.

.Steps
* Use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your Solaris OS, protocol, and ONTAP version support SAN booting.
* Follow the best practices for setting up a SAN boot in the Solaris vendor documentation.

Perform a local boot by installing the Solaris OS on the local hard disk, for example, an SSD, SATA, or RAID.
