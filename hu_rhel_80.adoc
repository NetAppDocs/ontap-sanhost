== SAN Booting

.What you'll need
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=91241;&solution=236&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.0 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. RHEL 8.0 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 8.0 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1238719[1238719^] | Kernel disruption on RHEL8 with QLogic QLE2672 16GB FC during storage failover operations | Kernel disruption might occur during storage failover operations on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 kernel with a QLogic QLE2672 host bus adapter (HBA). The kernel disruption causes the operating system to reboot. The reboot causes application disruption and generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/directory if kdump is configured.  Use the vmcore file to identify the cause of the failure. In this case, the disruption is in the “kmem_cache_alloc+160” module. It is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:    "[exception RIP: kmem_cache_alloc+160]". Reboot the host OS to recover the operating system and then restart the application. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1710009[1710009^]
