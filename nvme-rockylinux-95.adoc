This document describes how to configure NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) hosts for Rocky Linux 9.5. For more support and feature information, see link:hu-nvme-index.html[NVME-oF Overview^]. There are no known limitations for Rocky Linux 9.5.

== Step 1: Optionally, enable SAN booting

.Steps

. Install Rocky Linux 9.5 on the server. After the installation is complete, verify that you are running the required Rocky Linux 9.5 kernel: 
+
[source,cli]
----
uname -r

[NOTE]
====
Beginning with Rocky Linux 9.4, the setting for the NVMe/TCP `ctrl_loss_tmo timeout` is automatically set to "off". As a result:
