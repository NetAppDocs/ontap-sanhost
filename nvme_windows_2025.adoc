You can configure NVMe over Fibre Channel (NVMe/FC) on hosts running Windows Server 2025 for operation with ONTAP storage.

.About this task
You can use the following support with the NVMe-oF host configuration for Windows 2025. You should also review the known limitations before starting the configuration process.

* Support available:
+
Beginning with ONTAP 9.7, NVMe/FC is supported Windows Server 2025.
+
The Broadcom initiator can serve both NVMe/FC and FCP traffic through the same 32G FC adapter ports. For FCP and FC/NVMe, you should use Microsft device-specific module (DSM) as the Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) option.

* Known limitations:
+
Windows Failover Cluster (WFC) is not supported with NVMe/FC because ONTAP doesn't currently support persistent reservations with NVMe/FC.
+
NOTE: The external driver shipped by Broadcom for Windows NVMe/FC isn't a true NVMe/FC driver but a translational SCSI â‡„ NVMe driver. This translational overhead doesn't necessarily impact performance, but it does negate the performance benefits of NVMe/FC. As a result,  NVMe/FC and FCP performance is the same on Windows servers, unlike on other operating systems such as Linux, where NVMe/FC performance is significantly better than that of FCP.
