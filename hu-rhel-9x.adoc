[.lead] 
The Linux Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Linux hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Linux Host Utilities on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.x host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host

You can use multipathing with RHEL 9.x to manage ONTAP LUNs.

However, with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.3 QLogic host, only partial multipaths are recovered after a storage failover giveback operation. |RHEL 17811

The kernel disruption causes the operating system to reboot and if `kdump` is configured, it generates the `vmcore` file under the `/var/crash/` directory. The issue is being triaged with the `lpfc` driver but it cannot be reproduced consistently.
