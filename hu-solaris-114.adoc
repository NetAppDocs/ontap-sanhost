The Solaris Host Utilities software provides management and diagnostic tools for Solaris hosts that are connected to ONTAP storage. When you install the Solaris Host Utilities on a Solaris 11.4 host, you can use the Host Utilities to help you manage FCP and iSCSI protocol operations with ONTAP LUNs.

== Step 3: Confirm the multipath configuration for your host
You can use multipathing with Solaris 11.4 to manage ONTAP LUNs.

Multipathing enables you to configure multiple network paths between the host and storage systems. If one path fails, traffic continues on the remaining paths. Oracle Solaris I/O Multipathing (MPxIO) is enabled by default for Solaris 11.4 and SPARC systems.

To ensure that multipathing and the recommended timeout parameters are configured correctly for your host, verify that you're using the NetApp recommended settings for your ONTAP LUNs.

.Steps

. If your host is configured for FC, verify that the default setting in `/kernel/drv/fp.conf` is set to `mpxio-disable="no"`.

. The Solaris Host Utilities load the NetApp recommended parameter settings for SPARC and x86_64 processors.

FC driver binding is changed from `ssd (4D)` to `sd (4D)`. Move the existing configuration from `ssd.conf` to `sd.conf` as mentioned in Oracle DOC: 2595926.1). The behavior varies across newly installed Solaris 11.4 systems and systems upgraded from Solaris 11.3 or earlier versions.
