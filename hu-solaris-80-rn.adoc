The Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 release notes describe new features and enhancements, fixed issues, known problems and limitations, and important cautions related to configuring and managing your Solaris host with your ONTAP storage system.

For specific information about the operating system versions and updates that the Solaris Host Utilities support, see the link:https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

NOTE: The Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 support Solaris 11.4 with both SPARC and x86 platforms. For Solaris 11.3 and earlier versions, use Solaris Host Utilities 6.2. 

== What's new in Solaris Host Utilities 8.0

* Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 introduces the `disksort:false` and `cache-nonvolatile:true` parameter settings. These parameters suppress constant sync calls from the host. These sync calls impact performance and are unnecessary because ONTAP doesn't have volatile cache. For more information, see link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/solaris/oracle-solaris/11.4/tuning/ensuring-proper-cache-flush-behavior-flash-and-nvram-storage-devices.html[Cache Flush Behavior for Flash and NVRAM Storage Devices^].
* Solaris Host Utilities 8.0 facilitates the automated update of FC drivers. The FC drivers that bind the parameters for Solaris 11.4 now use SD (4D) instead of SSD (4D). For more information, see the link:https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/2595926_1.html[Oracle Support Doc ID 2595926.1^].
