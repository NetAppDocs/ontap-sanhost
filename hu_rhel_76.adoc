== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=85803;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 7.6 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1186754[1186754^] | Remote ports status on RHEL7U6 with QLogic QLE2742 host might be in blocked during host discovery | During host discovery, FC remote port status on RHEL7U6 host with a QLogic QLE2742 adapter might enter a blocked state. These blocked remote ports might result in the paths to LUNs becoming unavailable. During storage failover, the path redundancy might be reduced and result in I/O outage. You can check the remote port status by entering the following command:# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1628039[1628039^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1190698[1190698^] | Remote port status on RHEL7U6 with QLogic QLE2672 host might be in blocked during storage failover operations | FC remote ports might be blocked on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7U6 with the QLogic QLE2672 host during storage failover operations. Because the logical interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote ports set the storage node status to blocked. When the storage node returns to its optimal state, the logical interfaces also come up and the remote ports should be online. However, the remote portsmight still be blocked. This blocked state registers as failed faulty to LUNS at the multipath layer. You can verify the remote ports state with the following command:# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1643459[1643459^]
