The toolkit is installed automatically when you install the NetApp Host Utilities package. This kit provides the `sanlun` utility, which helps you manage LUNs and HBAs. The `sanlun` command returns information about the LUNs mapped to your host, multipathing, and information necessary to create initiator groups.
